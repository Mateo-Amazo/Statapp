      "['Greece (, ), officially the Hellenic Republic, is a country located in Southeastern Europe. Its population is approximately 10.7 million as of 2021; Athens is its largest and capital city, followed by Thessaloniki. Situated on the southern tip of the Balkans, Greece is located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. It shares land borders with Albania to the northwest, North Macedonia and Bulgaria to the north, and Turkey to the northeast. The Aegean Sea lies to the east of the mainland, the Ionian Sea to the west, the Cretan Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. Greece has the longest coastline on the Mediterranean Basin and the 11th longest coastline in the world at  in length, featuring  many islands, of which 227 are inhabited. Eighty percent of Greece is mountainous, with Mount Olympus being the highest peak at . The country consists of nine traditional geographic regions: Macedonia, Central Greece, the Peloponnese, Thessaly, Epirus, the Aegean Islands (including the Dodecanese and Cyclades), Thrace, Crete, and the Ionian Islands.\\n\\nGreece is considered the cradle of Western civilization, being the birthplace of democracy, Western philosophy, Western literature, historiography, political science, major scientific and mathematical principles, theatre and the Olympic Games. From the eighth century BC, the Greeks were organised into various independent city-states, known as poleis (singular polis), which spanned the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. Philip II of Macedon united most of present-day Greece in the fourth century BC, with his son Alexander the Great rapidly conquering much of the ancient world, from the eastern Mediterranean to India. The subsequent Hellenistic period saw the height of Greek culture and influence in antiquity. Greece was annexed by Rome in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the Roman Empire and its continuation, the Byzantine Empire, which was culturally and linguistically predominantly Greek. The Greek Orthodox Church, which emerged in the first century AD, helped shape modern Greek identity and transmitted Greek traditions to the wider Orthodox world. After falling under Ottoman rule in the mid-15th century, Greece emerged as a modern nation state in 1830 following a war of independence. The country\\'s rich historical legacy is reflected in part by its 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\\n\\nGreece is a unitary parliamentary republic, and a developed country, with an advanced high-income economy, and a high quality of life, ranking simultaneously very high in the Human Development Index. Its economy is the largest in the Balkans, where it is an important regional investor. A founding member of the United Nations, Greece was the tenth member to join the European Communities (precursor to the European Union) and has been part of the Eurozone since 2001. It is also a member of numerous other international institutions, including the Council of Europe, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the Organisation internationale de la Francophonie (OIF). Greece\\'s unique cultural heritage, large tourism industry, prominent shipping sector and geostrategic importance classify it as a middle power.\\n\\nName \\n\\nThe native name of the country in Modern Greek is  (, pronounced ). The corresponding form in Ancient Greek and conservative formal Modern Greek (Katharevousa) is  (, classical: , modern: ). This is the source of the English alternate name Hellas, which is mostly found in archaic or poetic contexts today. The Greek adjectival form  (, ) is sometimes also translated as Hellenic and is often rendered in this way in the formal names of Greek institutions, as in the official name of the Greek state, the Hellenic Republic (, ).\\n\\nThe English names Greece and Greek are derived, via the Latin  and , from the name of the Graeci (, ; singular , ), who were among the first ancient Greek tribes to settle Magna Graecia in southern Italy. The term is ultimately derived from the Proto-Indo-European root , \"to grow old\".\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nPrehistory and early history \\n\\nThe earliest evidence of the presence of human ancestors in the southern Balkans, dated to 270,000BC, is to be found in the Petralona cave, in the Greek province of Macedonia. The Apidima Cave in Mani, in southern Greece, contains the oldest remains of anatomically modern humans outside of Africa, dated to 210,000 years ago. All three stages of the Stone Age (Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic) are represented in Greece, for example in the Franchthi Cave. Neolithic settlements in Greece, dating from the 7th millennium BC, are the oldest in Europe by several centuries, as Greece lies on the route via which farming spread from the Near East to Europe. Following the end of the Greek Neolithic period in 3.200 BC, a slow transition period between the stone economy to the bronze economy during the end of the 4th Millennium BC including Eutresis culture and Korakou culture with the first large buildings (House of the Tiles) until the middle of the 3rd Millennium BC took place in the Greek mainland. Tiryns culture before the Middle Helladic period that developed the socioeconomic base of the following Minoan civilization and Mycenean civilisation. \\n\\nGreece is home to the first advanced civilizations in Europe and is considered the birthplace of Western civilisation, beginning with the Cycladic civilization on the islands of the Aegean Sea at around 3200 BC, the Minoan civilization in Crete (2700–1500 BC), and then the Mycenaean civilization on the mainland (1600–1100 BC). These civilizations possessed writing, the Minoans using an undeciphered script known as Linear A, and the Mycenaeans writing the earliest attested form of Greek in Linear B. The Mycenaeans gradually absorbed the Minoans, but collapsed violently around 1200 BC, along with other civilizations, during the regional event known as the Late Bronze Age collapse. This ushered in a period known as the Greek Dark Ages, from which written records are absent. Though the unearthed Linear B texts are too fragmentary for the reconstruction of the political landscape and can\\'t support the existence of a larger state, contemporary Hittite and Egyptian records suggest the presence of a single state under a \"Great King\" based in mainland Greece.\\n\\nArchaic and Classical period\\n\\nThe end of the Dark Ages is traditionally dated to 776 BC, the year of the first Olympic Games. The Iliad and the Odyssey, the foundational texts of Western literature, are believed to have been composed by Homer in the 7th or 8th centuries BC. With the end of the Dark Ages, there emerged various kingdoms and city-states across the Greek peninsula, which spread to the shores of the Black Sea, Southern Italy (\"Magna Graecia\") and Asia Minor. These states and their colonies reached great levels of prosperity that resulted in an unprecedented cultural boom, that of classical Greece, expressed in architecture, drama, science, mathematics and philosophy. In 508 BC, Cleisthenes instituted the world\\'s first democratic system of government in Athens.\\n\\nBy 500 BC, the Persian Empire controlled the Greek city states in Asia Minor and Macedonia. Attempts by some of the Greek city-states of Asia Minor to overthrow Persian rule failed, and Persia invaded the states of mainland Greece in 492 BC, but was forced to withdraw after a defeat at the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC. In response, the Greek city-states formed the Hellenic League in 481 BC, led by Sparta, which was the first historically recorded union of Greek states since the mythical union of the Trojan War. A second invasion by the Persians followed in 480 BC. Following decisive Greek victories in 480 and 479 BC at Salamis, Plataea, and Mycale, the Persians were forced to withdraw for a second time, marking their eventual withdrawal from all of their European territories. Led by Athens and Sparta, the Greek victories in the Greco-Persian Wars are considered a pivotal moment in world history, as the 50 years of peace that followed are known as the Golden Age of Athens, the seminal period of ancient Greek development that laid many of the foundations of Western civilization.\\n\\nLack of political unity within Greece resulted in frequent conflict between Greek states. The most devastating intra-Greek war was the Peloponnesian War (431–404 BC), won by Sparta and marking the demise of the Athenian Empire as the leading power in ancient Greece. Both Athens and Sparta were later overshadowed by Thebes and eventually Macedon, with the latter uniting most of the city-states of the Greek hinterland in the League of Corinth (also known as the Hellenic League or Greek League) under the control of Phillip II. Despite this development, the Greek world remained largely fragmented and would not be united under a single power until the Roman years. Sparta did not join the League and actively fought against it, raising an army led by Agis III to secure the city-states of Crete for Persia.\\n\\nFollowing the assassination of Phillip II, his son Alexander III (\"The Great\") assumed the leadership of the League of Corinth and launched an invasion of the Persian Empire with the combined forces of the League in 334 BC. Undefeated in battle, Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC. By the time of his death in 323 BC, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to India. Upon his death, his empire split into several kingdoms, the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia, and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa. Although the political unity of Alexander\\'s empire could not be maintained, it resulted in the Hellenistic civilization and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander. Greek science, technology, and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period.\\n\\nHellenistic and Roman periods (323 BC – 4th century AD) \\n\\nAfter a period of confusion following Alexander\\'s death, the Antigonid dynasty, descended from one of Alexander\\'s generals, established its control over Macedon and most of the Greek city-states by 276 BC. From about 200 BC the Roman Republic became increasingly involved in Greek affairs and engaged in a series of wars with Macedon. Macedon\\'s defeat at the Battle of Pydna in 168 BC signalled the end of Antigonid power in Greece. In 146 BC, Macedonia was annexed as a province by Rome, and the rest of Greece became a Roman protectorate.\\n\\nThe process was completed in 27 BC when the Roman emperor Augustus annexed the rest of Greece and constituted it as the senatorial province of Achaea. Despite their military superiority, the Romans admired and became heavily influenced by the achievements of Greek culture, hence Horace\\'s famous statement: Graecia capta ferum victorem cepit (\"Greece, although captured, took its wild conqueror captive\"). The epics of Homer inspired the Aeneid of Virgil, and authors such as Seneca the younger wrote using Greek styles. Roman heroes such as Scipio Africanus, tended to study philosophy and regarded Greek culture and science as an example to be followed. Similarly, most Roman emperors maintained an admiration for things Greek in nature. The Roman emperor Nero visited Greece in AD 66, and performed at the Ancient Olympic Games, despite the rules against non-Greek participation. Hadrian was also particularly fond of the Greeks. Before becoming emperor, he served as an eponymous archon of Athens.\\n\\nGreek-speaking communities of the Hellenised East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and Christianity\\'s early leaders and writers (notably St. Paul) were mostly Greek-speaking, though generally not from Greece itself. The New Testament was written in Greek, and some of its sections (Corinthians, Thessalonians, Philippians, Revelation of St. John of Patmos) attest to the importance of churches in Greece in early Christianity. Nevertheless, much of Greece clung tenaciously to paganism, and ancient Greek religious practices were still in vogue in the late 4th century AD, when they were outlawed by the Roman emperor Theodosius I in 391–392. The last recorded Olympic games were held in 393, and many temples were destroyed or damaged in the century that followed. In Athens and rural areas, paganism is attested well into the sixth century AD and even later. The closure of the Neoplatonic Academy of Athens by the Emperor Justinian in 529 is considered by many to mark the end of antiquity, although there is evidence that the Academy continued its activities for some time after that. Some remote areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remained pagan until well into the 10th century AD.\\n\\nMedieval period (4th – 15th century) \\n\\nThe Roman Empire in the east, following the fall of the Empire in the west in the 5th century, is conventionally known as the Byzantine Empire (but was simply called \"Kingdom of the Romans\" in its own time) and lasted until 1453. With its capital in Constantinople, its language and culture were Greek and its religion was predominantly Eastern Orthodox Christian.\\n\\nFrom the 4th century, the Empire\\'s Balkan territories, including Greece, suffered from the dislocation of barbarian invasions. The raids and devastation of the Goths and Huns in the 4th and 5th centuries and the Slavic invasion of Greece in the 7th century resulted in a dramatic collapse in imperial authority in the Greek peninsula. Following the Slavic invasion, the imperial government retained formal control of only the islands and coastal areas, particularly the densely populated walled cities such as Athens, Corinth and Thessalonica, while some mountainous areas in the interior held out on their own and continued to recognise imperial authority. Outside of these areas, a limited amount of Slavic settlement is generally thought to have occurred, although on a much smaller scale than previously thought. However, the view that Greece in late antiquity underwent a crisis of decline, fragmentation and depopulation is now considered outdated, as Greek cities show a high degree of institutional continuity and prosperity between the 4th and 6th centuries AD (and possibly later as well). In the early 6th century, Greece had approximately 80 cities according to the Synecdemus chronicle, and the period from the 4th to the 7th century AD is considered one of high prosperity not just in Greece but in the entire Eastern Mediterranean.\\n\\nUntil the 8th century almost all of modern Greece was under the jurisdiction of the Holy See of Rome according to the system of Pentarchy. Byzantine Emperor Leo III moved the border of the Patriarchate of Constantinople westward and northward in the 8th century.\\n\\nThe Byzantine recovery of lost provinces began toward the end of the 8th century and most of the Greek peninsula came under imperial control again, in stages, during the 9th century. This process was facilitated by a large influx of Greeks from Sicily and Asia Minor to the Greek peninsula, while at the same time many Slavs were captured and re-settled in Asia Minor and the few that remained were assimilated. During the 11th and 12th centuries the return of stability resulted in the Greek peninsula benefiting from strong economic growth\\xa0– much stronger than that of the Anatolian territories of the Empire. During that time, the Greek Orthodox Church was also instrumental in the spread of Greek ideas to the wider Orthodox world.\\n\\nFollowing the Fourth Crusade and the fall of Constantinople to the \"Latins\" in 1204, mainland Greece was split between the Greek Despotate of Epirus (a Byzantine successor state) and French rule (known as the Frankokratia), while some islands came under Venetian rule. The re-establishment of the Byzantine imperial capital in Constantinople in 1261 was accompanied by the empire\\'s recovery of much of the Greek peninsula, although the Frankish Principality of Achaea in the Peloponnese and the rival Greek Despotate of Epirus in the north both remained important regional powers into the 14th century, while the islands remained largely under Genoese and Venetian control. During the Paleologi dynasty (1261–1453) a new era of Greek patriotism emerged accompanied by a turning back to ancient Greece.\\n\\nAs such prominent personalities at the time also proposed changing the imperial title to \"Emperor of the Hellenes\", and, in late fourteenth century, the emperor was frequently referred to as the \"Emperor of the Hellenes\". Similarly, in several international treaties of that time the Byzantine emperor is styled as \"Imperator Graecorum\".\\n\\nIn the 14th century, much of the Greek peninsula was lost by the Byzantine Empire at first to the Serbs and then to the Ottomans. By the beginning of the 15th century, the Ottoman advance meant that Byzantine territory in Greece was limited mainly to its then-largest city, Thessaloniki, and the Peloponnese (Despotate of the Morea). After the fall of Constantinople to the Ottomans in 1453, the Morea was one of the last remnants of the Byzantine Empire to hold out against the Ottomans. However, this, too, fell to the Ottomans in 1460, completing the Ottoman conquest of mainland Greece. With the Turkish conquest, many Byzantine Greek scholars, who up until then were largely responsible for preserving Classical Greek knowledge, fled to the West, taking with them a large body of literature and thereby significantly contributing to the Renaissance.\\n\\nVenetian possessions and Ottoman rule (15th century – 1821) \\n\\nWhile most of mainland Greece and the Aegean islands was under Ottoman control by the end of the 15th century, Cyprus and Crete remained Venetian territory and did not fall to the Ottomans until 1571 and 1670 respectively. The only part of the Greek-speaking world that escaped long-term Ottoman rule was the Ionian Islands, which remained Venetian until their capture by the First French Republic in 1797, then passed to the United Kingdom in 1809 until their unification with Greece in 1864.\\n\\nWhile some Greeks in the Ionian Islands and Constantinople lived in prosperity, and Greeks of Constantinople (Phanariotes) achieved positions of power within the Ottoman administration, much of the population of mainland Greece suffered the economic consequences of the Ottoman conquest. Heavy taxes were enforced, and in later years the Ottoman Empire enacted a policy of creation of hereditary estates, effectively turning the rural Greek populations into serfs.\\n\\nThe Greek Orthodox Church and the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople were considered by the Ottoman governments as the ruling authorities of the entire Orthodox Christian population of the Ottoman Empire, whether ethnically Greek or not. Although the Ottoman state did not force non-Muslims to convert to Islam, Christians faced several types of discrimination intended to highlight their inferior status in the Ottoman Empire. Discrimination against Christians, particularly when combined with harsh treatment by local Ottoman authorities, led to conversions to Islam, if only superficially. In the 19th century, many \"crypto-Christians\" returned to their old religious allegiance.\\n\\nThe nature of Ottoman administration of Greece varied, though it was invariably arbitrary and often harsh. Some cities had governors appointed by the Sultan, while others (like Athens) were self-governed municipalities. Mountainous regions in the interior and many islands remained effectively autonomous from the central Ottoman state for many centuries.\\n\\nPrior to the Greek Revolution of 1821, there had been a number of wars which saw Greeks fight against the Ottomans, such as the Greek participation in the Battle of Lepanto in 1571, the Epirus peasants\\' revolts of 1600–1601 (led by the Orthodox bishop Dionysios Skylosophos), the Morean War of 1684–1699, and the Russian-instigated Orlov Revolt in 1770, which aimed at breaking up the Ottoman Empire in favour of Russian interests. These uprisings were put down by the Ottomans with great bloodshed. On the other side, many Greeks were conscripted as Ottoman citizens to serve in the Ottoman army (and especially the Ottoman navy), while also the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople, responsible for the Orthodox, remained in general loyal to the empire.\\n\\nThe 16th and 17th centuries are regarded as something of a \"dark age\" in Greek history, with the prospect of overthrowing Ottoman rule appearing remote with only the Ionian islands remaining free of Turkish domination. Corfu withstood three major sieges in 1537, 1571 and 1716 all of which resulted in the repulsion of the Ottomans. However, in the 18th century, due to their mastery of shipping and commerce, a wealthy and dispersed Greek merchant class arose. These merchants came to dominate trade within the Ottoman Empire, establishing communities throughout the Mediterranean, the Balkans, and Western Europe. Though the Ottoman conquest had cut Greece off from significant European intellectual movements such as the Reformation and the Enlightenment, these ideas together with the ideals of the French Revolution and romantic nationalism began to penetrate the Greek world via the mercantile diaspora. In the late 18th century, Rigas Feraios, the first revolutionary to envision an independent Greek state, published a series of documents relating to Greek independence, including but not limited to a national anthem and the first detailed map of Greece, in Vienna. Feraios was murdered by Ottoman agents in 1798.\\n\\nModern period\\n\\nGreek War of Independence (1821–1832) \\n\\nIn the late eighteenth century, an increase in secular learning during the Modern Greek Enlightenment led to the revival among Greeks of the diaspora of the notion of a Greek nation tracing its existence to ancient Greece, distinct from the other Orthodox peoples, and having a right to political autonomy. One of the organizations formed in this intellectual milieu was the Filiki Eteria, a secret organization formed by merchants in Odessa in 1814. Appropriating a long-standing tradition of Orthodox messianic prophecy aspiring to the resurrection of the eastern Roman empire and creating the impression they had the backing of Tsarist Russia, they managed amidst a crisis of Ottoman trade, from 1815 onwards, to engage traditional strata of the Greek Orthodox world in their liberal nationalist cause. The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolution in the Peloponnese, the Danubian Principalities and Constantinople. The first of these revolts began on 6 March 1821 in the Danubian Principalities under the leadership of Alexandros Ypsilantis, but it was soon put down by the Ottomans. The events in the north spurred the Greeks of the Peloponnese into action and on 17 March 1821 the Maniots declared war on the Ottomans.\\n\\nBy the end of the month, the Peloponnese was in open revolt against the Ottomans and by October 1821 the Greeks under Theodoros Kolokotronis had captured Tripolitsa. The Peloponnesian revolt was quickly followed by revolts in Crete, Macedonia and Central Greece, which would soon be suppressed. Meanwhile, the makeshift Greek navy was achieving success against the Ottoman navy in the Aegean Sea and prevented Ottoman reinforcements from arriving by sea. In 1822 and 1824 the Turks and Egyptians ravaged the islands, including Chios and Psara, committing wholesale massacres of the population. Approximately three-quarters of the Chios\\' Greek population of 120,000 were killed, enslaved or died of disease. This had the effect of galvanizing public opinion in western Europe in favour of the Greek rebels.\\n\\nTensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. Meanwhile, the Ottoman Sultan negotiated with Mehmet Ali of Egypt, who agreed to send his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain. Ibrahim landed in the Peloponnese in February 1825 and had immediate success: by the end of 1825, most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control, and the city of Missolonghi—put under siege by the Turks since April 1825—fell in April 1826. Although Ibrahim was defeated in Mani, he had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese, and Athens had been retaken.\\n\\nAfter years of negotiation, three great powers, France, Russian Empire, and the United Kingdom, decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. Following news that combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of Hydra, the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet at Navarino. A week-long standoff ended with the Battle of Navarino (20 October 1827) which resulted in the destruction of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet. A French expeditionary force was dispatched to supervise the evacuation of the Egyptian army from the Peloponnese, while the Greeks proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828. As a result of years of negotiation, the nascent Greek state was finally recognised under the London Protocol in 1830.\\n\\nKingdom of Greece\\n\\nIn 1827, Ioannis Kapodistrias, from Corfu, was chosen by the Third National Assembly at Troezen as the first governor of the First Hellenic Republic. Kapodistrias established a series of state, economic and military institutions. Soon tensions appeared between him and local interests. Following his assassination in 1831 and the subsequent London conference a year later, the Great Powers of Britain, France and Russia installed Bavarian Prince Otto von Wittelsbach as monarch. Otto\\'s reign was despotic, and in its first 11 years of independence Greece was ruled by a Bavarian oligarchy led by Joseph Ludwig von Armansperg as Prime Minister and, later, by Otto himself, who held the title of both King and Premier. Throughout this period Greece remained under the influence of its three protecting Great Powers, France, Russia, and the United Kingdom, as well as Bavaria. In 1843 an uprising forced Otto to grant a constitution and a representative assembly.\\n\\nDespite the absolutism of Otto\\'s reign, the early years proved instrumental in creating institutions (improving those established by Ioannis Kapodisrias) which are still the bedrock of Greek administration and education. Important steps were taken in areas including the education system, maritime and postal communications, effective civil administration and, most importantly, the legal code. Historical revisionism took the form of de-Byzantinification and de-Ottomanisation, in favour of promoting the country\\'s Ancient Greek heritage. In this spirit, the national capital was moved from Nafplio, where it had been since 1829, to Athens, which was at the time a smaller town  (this approach weighed heavily in the debate over the final selection of the country\\'s capital ). Religious reform also took place, and the Church of Greece was established as Greece\\'s national church, although Otto remained a Catholic. 25 March, the day of Annunciation, was chosen as the anniversary of the Greek War of Independence in order to reinforce the link between Greek identity and Orthodoxy. Pavlos Karolidis called the Bavarian efforts to create a modern state in Greece as \"not only appropriate for the peoples\\' needs, but also based on excellent administrative principles of the era\".\\n\\nOtto was deposed in the 23 October 1862 Revolution. Multiple causes led to his deposition and exile, including the Bavarian-dominated government, heavy taxation, and a failed attempt to annex Crete from the Ottoman Empire. The catalyst for the revolt was Otto\\'s dismissal of Konstantinos Kanaris from the Premiership. A year later, he was replaced by Prince Wilhelm (William) of Denmark, who took the name George I and brought with him the Ionian Islands as a coronation gift from Britain. A new Constitution in 1864 changed Greece\\'s form of government from constitutional monarchy to the more democratic crowned republic. In 1875 the concept of parliamentary majority as a requirement for the formation of a government was introduced by Charilaos Trikoupis, curbing the power of the monarchy to appoint minority governments of its preference.\\n\\nCorruption, coupled with Trikoupis\\' increased spending to fund infrastructure projects like the Corinth Canal, overtaxed the weak Greek economy and forced the declaration of public insolvency in 1893. Greece also accepted the imposition of an International Financial Control authority to pay off the country\\'s debtors. Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek: the language question. The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called Demotic. Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of Ancient Greek.\\n\\nGovernment documents and newspapers were consequently published in Katharevousa (purified) Greek, a form which few ordinary Greeks could read. Liberals favoured recognising Demotic as the national language, but conservatives and the Orthodox Church resisted all such efforts, to the extent that, when the New Testament was translated into Demotic in 1901, riots erupted in Athens and the government fell (the Evangeliaka). This issue would continue to plague Greek politics until the 1970s.\\n\\nAll Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the Hellenic lands under Ottoman rule. Especially in Crete, a prolonged revolt in 1866–1869 had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between Russia and the Ottomans in 1877, Greek popular sentiment rallied to Russia\\'s side, but Greece was too poor and too concerned about British intervention, to officially enter the war. Nevertheless, in 1881, Thessaly and small parts of Epirus were ceded to Greece as part of the Treaty of Berlin, while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete.\\n\\nGreeks in Crete continued to stage regular revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government under Theodoros Deligiannis, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing Greco-Turkish War of 1897, the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated by the Ottomans. Through the intervention of the Great Powers, however, Greece lost only a little territory along the border to Turkey, while Crete was established as an autonomous state under Prince George of Greece. With state coffers empty, fiscal policy came under International Financial Control. Alarmed by the abortive Ilinden uprising of the autonomist Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization (IMRO) in 1903, the Greek government, aiming to quell Komitadjis (IMRO bands) and detach the Slavophone peasants of the region from Bulgarian influence, sponsored a guerrilla campaign in Ottoman-ruled Macedonia, led by Greek officers and known as the Macedonian Struggle, which ended with the Young Turk Revolution in 1908.\\n\\nExpansion, disaster, and reconstruction \\n\\nAmidst general dissatisfaction with the seeming inertia and unattainability of national aspirations under the premiership of the cautious reformist Theotokis, a group of military officers organised a coup in August 1909 and shortly thereafter called to Athens Cretan politician Eleftherios Venizelos, who conveyed a vision of national regeneration. After winning two elections and becoming Prime Minister in 1910, Venizelos initiated wide-ranging fiscal, social, and constitutional reforms, reorganised the military, made Greece a member of the Balkan League, and led the country through the Balkan Wars. By 1913, Greece\\'s territory and population had almost doubled, annexing Crete, Epirus, and Macedonia. In the following years, the struggle between King Constantine I and charismatic Venizelos over the country\\'s foreign policy on the eve of First World War dominated the country\\'s political scene and divided the country into two opposing groups. During parts of WW1, Greece had two governments: A royalist pro-German one in Athens and a Venizelist pro-Entente one in Thessaloniki. The two governments were united in 1917, when Greece officially entered the war on the side of the Entente.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of World War I, Greece attempted further expansion into Asia Minor, a region with a large native Greek population at the time, but was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, contributing to a massive flight of Asia Minor Greeks. These events overlapped, with both happening during the Greek genocide (1914–1922), a period during which, according to various sources, Ottoman and Turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Asia Minor Greeks, along with similar numbers of Assyrians and a rather larger number of Armenians. The resultant Greek exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent, and expanded, in an official Population exchange between Greece and Turkey. The exchange was part of the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne which ended the war.\\n\\nThe following era was marked by instability, as over 1.5 million propertyless Greek refugees from Turkey had to be integrated into Greek society. Cappadocian Greeks, Pontian Greeks, and non-Greek followers of Greek Orthodoxy were all subject to the exchange as well. Some of the refugees could not speak the language and were from what had been unfamiliar environments to mainland Greeks, such as in the case of the Cappadocians and non-Greeks. The refugees also made a dramatic post-war population boost, as the number of refugees was more than a quarter of Greece\\'s prior population.\\n\\nFollowing the catastrophic events in Asia Minor, the monarchy was abolished via a referendum in 1924 and the Second Hellenic Republic was declared. In 1935, a royalist general-turned-politician Georgios Kondylis took power after a coup d\\'état and abolished the republic, holding a rigged referendum, after which King George II returned to Greece and was restored to the throne.\\n\\nDictatorship, World War II, and reconstruction \\n\\nAn agreement between Prime Minister Ioannis Metaxas and the head of state George II followed in 1936, which installed Metaxas as the head of a dictatorial regime known as the 4th of August Regime, inaugurating a period of authoritarian rule that would last, with short breaks, until 1974. Although a dictatorship, Greece remained on good terms with Britain and was not allied with the Axis.\\n\\nOn 28 October 1940, Fascist Italy demanded the surrender of Greece, but the Greek administration refused, and, in the following Greco-Italian War, Greece repelled Italian forces into Albania, giving the Allies their first victory over Axis forces on land. The Greek struggle and victory against the Italians received exuberant praise at the time. Most prominent is the quote attributed to Winston Churchill: \"Hence we will not say that Greeks fight like heroes, but we will say that heroes fight like Greeks.\" French general Charles de Gaulle was among those who praised the fierceness of the Greek resistance. In an official notice released to coincide with the Greek national celebration of the Day of Independence, De Gaulle expressed his admiration for the Greek resistance:In the name of the captured yet still alive French people, France wants to send her greetings to the Greek people who are fighting for their freedom. The 25 March 1941 finds Greece in the peak of their heroic struggle and in the top of their glory. Since the Battle of Salamis, Greece had not achieved the greatness and the glory which today holds. The country would eventually fall to urgently dispatched German forces during the Battle of Greece, despite the fierce Greek resistance, particularly in the Battle of the Metaxas Line. Adolf Hitler himself recognised the bravery and the courage of the Greek army, stating in his address to the Reichstag on 11 December 1941, that: \"Historical justice obliges me to state that of the enemies who took up positions against us, the Greek soldier particularly fought with the highest courage. He capitulated only when further resistance had become impossible and useless.\"\\n\\nThe Nazis proceeded to administer Athens and Thessaloniki, while other regions of the country were given to Nazi Germany\\'s partners, Fascist Italy and Bulgaria. The occupation brought about terrible hardships for the Greek civilian population. Over 100,000 civilians died of starvation during the winter of 1941–1942, tens of thousands more died because of reprisals by Nazis and collaborators, the country\\'s economy was ruined, and the great majority of Greek Jews (tens of thousands) were deported and murdered in Nazi concentration camps. The Greek Resistance, one of the most effective resistance movements in Europe, fought vehemently against the Nazis and their collaborators. The German occupiers committed numerous atrocities, mass executions, and wholesale slaughter of civilians and destruction of towns and villages in reprisals. In the course of the concerted anti-guerrilla campaign, hundreds of villages were systematically torched and almost 1 million Greeks left homeless. In total, the Germans executed some 21,000 Greeks, the Bulgarians 40,000, and the Italians 9,000.\\n\\nFollowing liberation and the Allied victory over the Axis, Greece annexed the Dodecanese Islands from Italy and regained Western Thrace from Bulgaria. The country almost immediately descended into a bloody civil war between communist forces and the anti-communist Greek government, which lasted until 1949 with the latter\\'s victory. The conflict, considered one of the earliest struggles of the Cold War, resulted in further economic devastation, mass population displacement and severe political polarisation for the next thirty years.\\n\\nAlthough the post-war decades were characterised by social strife and widespread marginalisation of the left in political and social spheres, Greece nonetheless experienced rapid economic growth and recovery, propelled in part by the U.S.-administered Marshall Plan. In 1952, Greece joined NATO, reinforcing its membership in the Western Bloc of the Cold War.\\n\\nMilitary regime (1967–74)\\nKing Constantine II\\'s dismissal of George Papandreou\\'s centrist government in July 1965 prompted a prolonged period of political turbulence, which culminated in a coup d\\'état on 21 April 1967 by the Regime of the Colonels. Under the junta, civil rights were suspended, political repression was intensified, and human rights abuses, including state-sanctioned torture, were rampant. Economic growth remained rapid before plateauing in 1972. The brutal suppression of the Athens Polytechnic uprising on 17 November 1973 set in motion the events that caused the fall of the Papadopoulos regime, resulting in a counter-coup which overthrew Georgios Papadopoulos and established brigadier Dimitrios Ioannidis as the new junta strongman. On 20 July 1974, Turkey invaded the island of Cyprus in response to a Greek-backed Cypriot coup, triggering a political crisis in Greece that led to the regime\\'s collapse and the restoration of democracy through Metapolitefsi.\\n\\nThird Hellenic Republic \\n\\nThe former prime minister Konstantinos Karamanlis was invited back from Paris where he had lived in self-exile since 1963, marking the beginning of the Metapolitefsi era. The first multiparty elections since 1964 were held on the first anniversary of the Polytechnic uprising. A democratic and republican constitution was promulgated on 11 June 1975 following a referendum which chose to not restore the monarchy.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Andreas Papandreou, George Papandreou\\'s son, founded the Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) in response to Karamanlis\\'s conservative New Democracy party, with the two political formations dominating in government over the next four decades. Greece rejoined NATO in 1980. Greece became the tenth member of the European Communities (subsequently subsumed by the European Union) on 1 January 1981, ushering in a period of sustained growth. Widespread investments in industrial enterprises and heavy infrastructure, as well as funds from the European Union and growing revenues from tourism, shipping, and a fast-growing service sector raised the country\\'s standard of living to unprecedented levels. Traditionally strained relations with neighbouring Turkey improved when successive earthquakes hit both nations in 1999, leading to the lifting of the Greek veto against Turkey\\'s bid for EU membership.\\n\\nRecent history \\n\\nThe country adopted the euro in 2001 and successfully hosted the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in Athens. More recently, Greece has suffered greatly from the late-2000s recession and has been central to the related European sovereign debt crisis. Due to the adoption of the euro, when Greece experienced financial crisis, it could no longer devalue its currency to regain competitiveness. Youth unemployment was especially high during the 2000s. The Greek government-debt crisis, and subsequent austerity policies, have resulted in protests and social strife. Left-wing Syriza, led by Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, governed Greece since 2015 until 2019. Syriza gained support by opposing the austerity policy that had affected Greeks since the beginning of the Greek government-debt crisis. However, prime minister Tsipras was succeeded by Kyriakos Mitsotakis after the landslide victory of centre-right New Democracy in the 2019 elections.\\n\\nIn March 2020, Greece\\'s parliament elected a non-partisan candidate, Ekaterini Sakellaropoulou, as the first female President of Greece.\\n\\nGeography \\n\\nLocated in Southern and Southeast Europe, Greece consists of a mountainous, peninsular mainland jutting out into the sea at the southern end of the Balkans, ending at the Peloponnese peninsula (separated from the mainland by the canal of the Isthmus of Corinth) and strategically located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa. Due to its highly indented coastline and numerous islands, Greece has the 11th longest coastline in the world with ; its land boundary is . The country lies approximately between latitudes 34° and 42° N, and longitudes 19° and 30° E, with the extreme points being:\\nNorth: Ormenio village\\nSouth: Gavdos island\\nEast: Strongyli (Kastelorizo, Megisti) island\\nWest: Othonoi island\\n\\nEighty percent of Greece consists of mountains or hills, making the country one of the most mountainous in Europe. Mount Olympus, the mythical abode of the Greek Gods, culminates at Mytikas peak , the highest in the country. Western Greece contains a number of lakes and wetlands and is dominated by the Pindus mountain range. The Pindus, a continuation of the Dinaric Alps, reaches a maximum elevation of  at Mt. Smolikas (the second-highest in Greece) and historically has been a significant barrier to east–west travel.\\n\\nThe Pindus range continues through the central Peloponnese, crosses the islands of Kythera and Antikythera and finds its way into southwestern Aegean, in the island of Crete where it eventually ends. The islands of the Aegean are peaks of underwater mountains that once constituted an extension of the mainland. Pindus is characterised by its high, steep peaks, often dissected by numerous canyons and a variety of other karstic landscapes. The spectacular Vikos Gorge, part of the Vikos-Aoos National Park in the Pindus range, is listed by the Guinness book of World Records as the deepest gorge in the world. Another notable formation are the Meteora rock pillars, atop which have been built medieval Greek Orthodox monasteries.\\n\\nNortheastern Greece features another high-altitude mountain range, the Rhodope range, spreading across the region of East Macedonia and Thrace; this area is covered with vast, thick, ancient forests, including the famous Dadia Forest in the Evros regional unit, in the far northeast of the country.\\n\\nExtensive plains are primarily located in the regions of Thessaly, Central Macedonia and Thrace. They constitute key economic regions as they are among the few arable places in the country. Rare marine species such as the pinniped seals and the loggerhead sea turtle live in the seas surrounding mainland Greece, while its dense forests are home to the endangered brown bear, the Eurasian lynx, the roe deer and the wild goat.\\n\\nIslands \\n\\nGreece features a vast number of islands - between 1,200 and 6,000, depending on the definition, 227 of which are inhabited - and is considered a non-contiguous transcontinental country. Crete is the largest and most populous island; Euboea, separated from the mainland by the 60\\xa0m-wide Euripus Strait, is the second largest, followed by Lesbos and Rhodes.\\n\\nThe Greek islands are traditionally grouped into the following clusters: the Argo-Saronic Islands in the Saronic gulf near Athens, the Cyclades, a large but dense collection occupying the central part of the Aegean Sea, the North Aegean islands, a loose grouping off the west coast of Turkey, the Dodecanese, another loose collection in the southeast between Crete and Turkey, the Sporades, a small tight group off the coast of northeast Euboea, and the Ionian Islands, located to the west of the mainland in the Ionian Sea.\\n\\nClimate \\n\\nThe climate of Greece is primarily Mediterranean, featuring mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. This climate occurs at all coastal locations, including Athens, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, Crete, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands and parts of the Central Continental Greece region. The Pindus mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country, as areas to the west of the range are considerably wetter on average (due to greater exposure to south-westerly systems bringing in moisture) than the areas lying to the east of the range (due to a rain shadow effect).\\n\\nThe mountainous areas of Northwestern Greece (parts of Epirus, Central Greece, Thessaly, Western Macedonia) as well as in the mountainous central parts of Peloponnese\\xa0– including parts of the regional units of Achaea, Arcadia and Laconia\\xa0– feature an Alpine climate with heavy snowfalls. The inland parts of northern Greece, in Central Macedonia and East Macedonia and Thrace feature a temperate climate with cold, damp winters and hot, dry summers with frequent thunderstorms. Snowfalls occur every year in the mountains and northern areas, and brief snowfalls are not unknown even in low-lying southern areas, such as Athens.\\n\\nBiodiversity \\n\\nPhytogeographically, Greece belongs to the Boreal Kingdom and is shared between the East Mediterranean province of the Mediterranean Region and the Illyrian province of the Circumboreal Region. According to the World Wide Fund for Nature and the European Environment Agency, the territory of Greece can be subdivided into six ecoregions: the Illyrian deciduous forests, Pindus Mountains mixed forests, Balkan mixed forests, Rhodope montane mixed forests, Aegean and Western Turkey sclerophyllous and mixed forests, and Crete Mediterranean forests. It had a 2018 Forest Landscape Integrity Index mean score of 6.6/10, ranking it 70th globally out of 172 countries.\\n\\nPolitics \\n\\nGreece is a unitary parliamentary republic. The current Constitution was drawn up and adopted by the Fifth Revisionary Parliament of the Hellenes and entered into force in 1975 after the fall of the military junta of 1967–1974. It has been revised three times since, in 1986, 2001, 2008 and 2019. The Constitution, which consists of 120 articles, provides for a separation of powers into executive, legislative, and judicial branches, and grants extensive specific guarantees (further reinforced in 2001) of civil liberties and social rights. Women\\'s suffrage was guaranteed with an amendment to the 1952 Constitution.\\n\\nThe nominal head of state is the President of the Republic, who is elected by the Parliament for a five-year term. According to the Constitution, executive power is exercised by the President and the Government. However, the Constitutional amendment of 1986 curtailed the President\\'s duties and powers to a significant extent, rendering the position largely ceremonial; most political power is thus vested in the Prime Minister, Greece\\'s head of government. The position is filled by the current leader of the political party that can obtain a vote of confidence by the Parliament. The President of the Republic formally appoints the Prime Minister and, on his recommendation, appoints and dismisses the other members of the Cabinet.\\n\\nLegislative powers are exercised by a 300-member elective unicameral Parliament. Statutes passed by the Parliament are promulgated by the President of the Republic. Parliamentary elections are held every four years, but the President of the Republic is obliged to dissolve the Parliament earlier on the proposal of the Cabinet, in view of dealing with a national issue of exceptional importance. The President is also obliged to dissolve the Parliament earlier, if the opposition manages to pass a motion of no confidence. The voting age is 17.\\n\\nAccording to a 2016 report by the OECD, Greeks display a moderate level of civic participation compared to most other developed countries; voter turnout was 64 percent during recent elections, lower than the OECD average of 69 percent.\\n\\nPolitical parties \\n\\nSince the restoration of democracy, the Greek party system was dominated by the liberal-conservative New Democracy (ND) and the social-democratic Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK). Other parties represented in the Hellenic Parliament include the Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA), the Communist Party of Greece (KKE), Greek Solution and MeRA25.\\n\\nPASOK and New Democracy largely alternated in power until the outbreak of the government-debt crisis in 2009. From that time, the two major parties, New Democracy and PASOK, experienced a sharp decline in popularity. In November 2011, the two major parties joined the smaller Popular Orthodox Rally in a grand coalition, pledging their parliamentary support for a government of national unity headed by former European Central Bank vice-president Lucas Papademos. Panos Kammenos voted against this government and he split off from ND forming the right-wing populist Independent Greeks.\\n\\nThe coalition government led the country to the parliamentary elections of May 2012. The power of the traditional Greek political parties, PASOK and New Democracy, declined from 43% to 13% and from 33% to 18%, respectively. The left-wing party of SYRIZA became the second major party, with an increase from 4% to 16%. No party could form a sustainable government, which led to the parliamentary elections of June 2012. The result of the second elections was the formation of a coalition government composed of New Democracy (29%), PASOK (12%) and Democratic Left (6%) parties.\\n\\nSYRIZA has since overtaken PASOK as the main party of the centre-left . Alexis Tsipras led SYRIZA to victory in the general election held on 25 January 2015, falling short of an outright majority in Parliament by just two seats. The following morning, Tsipras reached an agreement with Independent Greeks party to form a coalition, and he was sworn in as Prime Minister of Greece. Tsipras called snap elections in August 2015, resigning from his post, which led to a month-long caretaker administration headed by judge Vassiliki Thanou-Christophilou, Greece\\'s first female prime minister. In the September 2015 general election, Alexis Tsipras led SYRIZA to another victory, winning 145 out of 300 seats and re-forming the coalition with the Independent Greeks. However, he was defeated in the July 2019 general election by Kyriakos Mitsotakis who leads New Democracy. On 7 July 2019, Kyriakos Mitsotakis was sworn in as the new Prime Minister of Greece. He formed a centre-right government after the landslide victory of his New Democracy party.\\n\\nForeign relations \\n\\nGreece\\'s foreign policy is conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its head, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, currently Nikos Dendias. Officially, the main aims of the Ministry are to represent Greece before other states and international organizations; safeguard the interests of the Greek state and of its citizens abroad; promote Greek culture; foster closer relations with the Greek diaspora; and encourage international cooperation.\\n\\nFollowing the resolution of the Macedonia naming dispute with the Prespa Agreement in 2018, the Ministry identifies two remaining issues of particular importance to the Greek state: Turkish challenges to Greek sovereignty rights in the Aegean Sea and corresponding airspace and the Cyprus dispute involving the Turkish occupation of Northern Cyprus.\\n\\nThere is a long-standing conflict between Turkey and Greece over natural resources in the eastern Mediterranean. Turkey doesn\\'t recognize a legal continental shelf and exclusive economic zone around the Greek islands.\\n\\nAdditionally, due to its political and geographical proximity to Europe, Asia, the Middle East and Africa, Greece is a country of significant geostrategic importance, which it has leveraged to develop a regional policy to help promote peace and stability in the Balkans, the Mediterranean, and the Middle East. This has accorded the country middle power status in global affairs.\\n\\nGreece is a member of numerous international organizations, including the Council of Europe, the European Union, the Union for the Mediterranean, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Organisation internationale de la francophonie and the United Nations, of which it is a founding member.\\n\\nMilitary \\n\\nThe Hellenic Armed Forces are overseen by the Hellenic National Defense General Staff (Greek: Γενικό Επιτελείο Εθνικής Άμυνας\\xa0– ΓΕΕΘΑ), with civilian authority vested in the Ministry of National Defence. It consists of three branches:\\n Hellenic Army (Ellinikos Stratos, ES)\\n Hellenic Navy (Elliniko Polemiko Navtiko, EPN)\\n Hellenic Air Force (Elliniki Polemiki Aeroporia, EPA)\\n\\nMoreover, Greece maintains the Hellenic Coast Guard for law enforcement at sea, search and rescue, and port operations. Though it can support the navy during wartime, it resides under the authority of the Ministry of Shipping.\\n\\nGreek military personnel total 364,050, of whom 142,700 are active and 221,350 are reserve. Greece ranks 28th in the world in the number of citizens serving in the armed forces. Mandatory military service is nine months for the Army and one year for the Navy and Air Force. Additionally, Greek males between the ages of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard.\\n\\nAs a member of NATO, the Greek military participates in exercises and deployments under the auspices of the alliance, although its involvement in NATO missions is minimal. Greece spends over US$7 billion annually on its military, or 2.3 percent of GDP, the 24th-highest in the world in absolute terms, the seventh-highest on a per capita basis, and the second-highest in NATO after the United States. Moreover, Greece is one of only five NATO countries to meet or surpass the minimum defence spending target of 2 percent of GDP.\\n\\nLaw and justice \\n\\nThe Judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature and comprises three Supreme Courts: the Court of Cassation (Άρειος Πάγος), the Council of State (Συμβούλιο της Επικρατείας) and the Court of Auditors (Ελεγκτικό Συνέδριο). The Judiciary system is also composed of civil courts, which judge civil and penal cases and administrative courts, which judge disputes between the citizens and the Greek administrative authorities.\\n\\nThe Hellenic Police () is the national police force of Greece. It is a very large agency with its responsibilities ranging from road traffic control to counter-terrorism. It was established in 1984 under Law 1481/1-10-1984 (Government Gazette 152 A) as the result of the fusion of the Gendarmerie (Χωροφυλακή, Chorofylaki) and the Cities Police (Αστυνομία Πόλεων, Astynomia Poleon) forces.\\n\\nAdministrative divisions \\n\\nSince the Kallikratis programme reform entered into effect on 1 January 2011, Greece has consisted of 13 regions subdivided into a total of 325, from 2019 232 (Cleisthenes programme), municipalities. The 54 old prefectures and prefecture-level administrations have been largely retained as sub-units of the regions. Seven decentralised administrations group one to three regions for administrative purposes on a regional basis. There is also one autonomous area, Mount Athos (, \"Holy Mountain\"), which borders the region of Central Macedonia.\\n\\nEconomy\\n\\nIntroduction \\n\\nAccording to World Bank statistics for the year 2013, the economy of Greece is the 43rd largest by nominal gross domestic product at $242 billion and 53rd largest by purchasing power parity (PPP) at $284 billion. Additionally, Greece is the 15th largest economy in the 27-member European Union. In terms of per capita income, Greece is ranked 41st or 47th in the world at $18,168 and $29,045 for nominal GDP and PPP respectively. The Greek economy is classified as advanced and high-income.\\n\\nGreece is a developed country with a high standard of living and a high ranking in the Human Development Index. Its economy mainly comprises the service sector (85.0%) and industry (12.0%), while agriculture makes up 3.0% of the national economic output. Important Greek industries include tourism (with 14.9 million international tourists in 2009, it is ranked as the 7th most visited country in the European Union and 16th in the world by the United Nations World Tourism Organization) and merchant shipping (at 16.2% of the world\\'s total capacity, the Greek merchant marine is the largest in the world), while the country is also a considerable agricultural producer (including fisheries) within the union.\\n\\nIn October 2021, unemployment stood at 12.9% and youth unemployment at 33.2%, compared to respectively 7% and 15.9% in the EU and in the Euro zone.\\n\\nWith an economy larger than all the other Balkan economies combined, Greece is the largest economy in the Balkans, and an important regional investor. Greece is the number-two foreign investor of capital in Albania, the number-three foreign investor in Bulgaria, at the top-three of foreign investors in Romania and Serbia and the most important trading partner and largest foreign investor of North Macedonia. Greek banks open a new branch somewhere in the Balkans on an almost weekly basis. The Greek telecommunications company OTE has become a strong investor in other Balkan countries.\\n\\nGreece was a founding member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC). In 1979 the accession of the country in the European Communities and the single market was signed, and the process was completed in 1982. Greece was accepted into the Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union on 19 June 2000, and in January 2001 adopted the Euro as its currency, replacing the Greek drachma at an exchange rate of 340.75 drachma to the Euro. Greece is also a member of the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization, and is ranked 24th on the KOF Globalization Index for 2013.\\n\\nDebt crisis (2010–2018) \\n\\nThe Greek economy had fared well for much of the 20th century, with high growth rates and low public debt. Even until the eve of the Financial crisis of 2007–2008, it featured high rates of growth, which, however, were coupled with high structural deficits, thus maintaining a (roughly unchanged throughout this period) public debt to GDP ratio of just over 100%. The Greek crisis was triggered by the turmoil of the 2007–2009 Great Recession, which led the budget deficits of several Western nations to reach or exceed 10% of GDP. In Greece\\'s case, the high budget deficit (which, after several corrections and revisions, was revealed to have been allowed to reach 10.2% and 15.1% of GDP in 2008 and 2009, respectively) was coupled with a high public debt to GDP ratio (relatively stable, at just over 100% until 2007 - as calculated after all corrections). Thus, the country appeared to lose control of its public debt to GDP ratio, which already reached 127% of GDP in 2009. In addition, being a member of the Eurozone, the country had essentially no autonomous monetary policy flexibility. \\nFinally, there was an effect of controversies about Greek statistics (due to the aforementioned drastic budget deficit revisions which led to an increase in the calculated value of the Greek public debt by about 10%, i.e., a public debt to GDP of about 100% until 2007), while there have been arguments about a possible effect of media reports. Consequently, Greece was \"punished\" by the markets which increased borrowing rates, making it impossible for the country to finance its debt since early 2010.\\n\\nThe above revisions were largely connected with the fact that in the years before the crisis Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, and numerous other banks had developed financial products which enabled the governments of Greece, Italy, and many other European countries to hide their borrowing. Dozens of similar agreements were concluded across Europe whereby banks supplied cash in advance in exchange for future payments by the governments involved; in turn, the liabilities of the involved countries were \"kept off the books\". These conditions had enabled Greece as well as other European governments to spend beyond their means, while meeting the deficit targets set out in the Maastricht Treaty.\\n\\nIn May 2010, the Greece\\'s deficit was again revised and estimated to be 13.6% which was the second highest in the world relative to GDP, with Iceland in first place at 15.7% and the United Kingdom in third with 12.6%. Public debt was forecast, according to some estimates, to hit 120% of GDP in the same year, causing a crisis of confidence in Greece\\'s ability pay back loans.\\n\\nTo avert a sovereign default, Greece, the other Eurozone members, and the International Monetary Fund agreed on a rescue package which involved giving Greece an immediate € in loans, with additional funds to follow, totaling €. To secure the funding, Greece was required to adopt harsh austerity measures to bring its deficit under control. A second bail-out amounting to € ($) was agreed in 2012, subject to strict conditions, including financial reforms and further austerity measures. A debt haircut was also agreed as part of the deal. Greece achieved a primary government budget surplus in 2013, while in April 2014, it returned to the global bond market. Greece returned to growth after six years of economic decline in the second quarter of 2014, and was the Eurozone\\'s fastest-growing economy in the third quarter. A third bailout was agreed in July 2015, after a confrontation with the newly elected government of Alexis Tsipras.\\n\\nThere was a 25% drop in Greece\\'s GDP, connected with the bailout programmes. This had a critical effect: the Debt-to-GDP ratio, the key factor defining the severity of the crisis, would jump from its 2009 level of 127% to about 170%, solely due to the shrinking economy. In a 2013 report, the IMF admitted that it had underestimated the effects of so extensive tax hikes and budget cuts on the country\\'s GDP and issued an informal apology. The Greek programmes imposed a very rapid improvement in structural primary balance (at least two times faster than for other Eurozone bailed-out countries). The policies have been blamed for worsening the crisis, while Greece\\'s president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos, stressed the creditors\\' share in responsibility for the depth of the crisis. Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras, asserted that errors in the design of the first two programmes which led to a loss of 25% of the Greek economy due to the harsh imposition of excessive austerity.\\n\\nBetween 2009 and 2017 the Greek government debt rose from €300 bn to €318 bn, i.e. by only about 6% (thanks, in part, to the 2012 debt restructuring); however, during the same period, the critical debt-to-GDP ratio shot up from 127% to 179% basically due to the severe GDP drop during the handling of the crisis.\\n\\nGreece\\'s bailouts successfully ended (as declared) on 20 August 2018.\\n\\nAgriculture \\n\\nIn 2010, Greece was the European Union\\'s largest producer of cotton (183,800 tons) and pistachios (8,000 tons) and ranked second in the production of rice (229,500 tons) and olives (147,500 tons), third in the production of figs (11,000 tons), almonds (44,000 tons), tomatoes (1,400,000 tons), and watermelons (578,400 tons) and fourth in the production of tobacco (22,000 tons). Agriculture contributes 3.8% of the country\\'s GDP and employs 12.4% of the country\\'s labor force.\\n\\nGreece is a major beneficiary of the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. As a result of the country\\'s entry to the European Community, much of its agricultural infrastructure has been upgraded and agricultural output increased. Between 2000 and 2007, organic farming in Greece increased by 885%, the highest change percentage in the EU.\\n\\nEnergy \\n\\nElectricity production in Greece is dominated by the state-owned Public Power Corporation (known mostly by its acronym ΔΕΗ, transliterated as DEI). In 2009 DEI supplied for 85.6% of all electric energy demand in Greece, while the number fell to 77.3% in 2010. Almost half (48%) of DEI\\'s power output is generated using lignite, a drop from the 51.6% in 2009.\\n\\nTwelve percent of Greece\\'s electricity comes from hydroelectric power plants and another 20% from natural gas. Between 2009 and 2010, independent companies\\' energy production increased by 56%, from 2,709 Gigawatt hour in 2009 to 4,232 GWh in 2010.\\n\\nIn 2012, renewable energy accounted for 13.8% of the country\\'s total energy consumption, a rise from the 10.6% it accounted for in 2011, a figure almost equal to the EU average of 14.1% in 2012. 10% of the country\\'s renewable energy comes from solar power, while most comes from biomass and waste recycling. In line with the European Commission\\'s Directive on Renewable Energy, Greece aims to get 18% of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.\\n\\nIn 2013, according to the independent power transmission operator in Greece (ΑΔΜΗΕ) more than 20% of the electricity in Greece has been produced from renewable energy sources and hydroelectric powerplants. This percentage in April reached 42%. Greece currently does not have any nuclear power plants in operation; however, in 2009 the Academy of Athens suggested that research in the possibility of Greek nuclear power plants begin.\\n\\nMaritime industry \\n\\nThe shipping industry has been a key element of Greek economic activity since ancient times. Shipping remains one of the country\\'s most important industries, accounting for 4.5 percent of GDP, employing about 160,000 people (4 percent of the workforce), and representing a third of the trade deficit.\\n\\nAccording to a 2011 report by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the Greek Merchant Navy is the largest in the world at 16.2 percent of total global capacity, up from 15.96 percent in 2010 but below the peak of 18.2 percent in 2006. The country\\'s merchant fleet ranks first in total tonnage (202 million dwt), fourth in total number of ships (at 3,150), first in both tankers and dry bulk carriers, fourth in the number of containers, and fifth in other ships. However, today\\'s fleet roster is smaller than an all-time high of 5,000 ships in the late 1970s. Additionally, the total number of ships flying a Greek flag (includes non-Greek fleets) is 1,517, or 5.3 percent of the world\\'s dwt (ranked fifth globally).\\n\\nDuring the 1960s, the size of the Greek fleet nearly doubled, primarily through the investment undertaken by the shipping magnates, Aristotle Onassis and Stavros Niarchos. The basis of the modern Greek maritime industry was formed after World War II when Greek shipping businessmen were able to amass surplus ships sold to them by the U.S. government through the Ship Sales Act of the 1940s.\\n\\nGreece has a significant shipbuilding and ship maintenance industry. The six shipyards around the port of Piraeus are among the largest in Europe. In recent years, Greece has also become a leader in the construction and maintenance of luxury yachts.\\n\\nTourism \\n\\nTourism has been a key element of the economic activity in the country and one of the country\\'s most important sectors, contributing 20.6% of the gross domestic product as of 2018. Greece welcomed over 28 million visitors in 2016, which is an increase from the 26.5 million tourists it welcomed in 2015 and the 19.5 million in 2009, and the 17.7 million tourists in 2007, making Greece one of the most visited countries in Europe in the recent years.\\n\\nThe vast majority of visitors in Greece in 2007 came from the European continent, numbering 12.7 million, while the most visitors from a single nationality were those from the United Kingdom, (2.6 million), followed closely by those from Germany (2.3 million). In 2010, the most visited region of Greece was that of Central Macedonia, with 18% of the country\\'s total tourist flow (amounting to 3.6 million tourists), followed by Attica with 2.6 million and the Peloponnese with 1.8 million. Northern Greece is the country\\'s most-visited geographical region, with 6.5 million tourists, while Central Greece is second with 6.3 million.\\n\\nIn 2010, Lonely Planet ranked Greece\\'s northern and second-largest city of Thessaloniki as the world\\'s fifth-best party town worldwide, comparable to other cities such as Dubai and Montreal. In 2011, Santorini was voted as \"The World\\'s Best Island\" in Travel + Leisure. Its neighboring island Mykonos, came in fifth in the European category. There are 18 UNESCO World Heritage Sites in Greece, and Greece is ranked 16th in the world in terms of total sites. 14 further sites are on the tentative list, awaiting nomination.\\n\\nTransport \\n\\nSince the 1980s, the road and rail network of Greece has been significantly modernised. Important works include the A2 (Egnatia Odos) motorway, that connects northwestern Greece (Igoumenitsa) with northern Greece (Thessaloniki) and northeastern Greece (Kipoi); the Rio–Antirrio bridge, the longest suspension cable bridge in Europe ( long), connecting the Peloponnese (Rio,  from Patras) with Aetolia-Akarnania (Antirrio) in western Greece.\\n\\nAlso completed are the A5 (Ionia Odos) motorway that connects northwestern Greece (Ioannina) with western Greece (Antirrio); the last sections of the A1 motorway, connecting Athens to Thessaloniki and Evzonoi in northern Greece; as well as the A8 motorway (part of the Olympia Odos) in Peloponnese, connecting Athens to Patras. The remaining section of Olympia Odos, connecting Patras with Pyrgos, is under planning.\\n\\nOther important projects that are currently underway, include the construction of the Thessaloniki Metro.\\n\\nThe Athens Metropolitan Area in particular is served by some of the most modern and efficient transport infrastructure in Europe, such as the Athens International Airport, the privately run A6 (Attiki Odos) motorway network and the expanded Athens Metro system.\\n\\nMost of the Greek islands and many main cities of Greece are connected by air mainly from the two major Greek airlines, Olympic Air and Aegean Airlines. Maritime connections have been improved with modern high-speed craft, including hydrofoils and catamarans.\\n\\nRailway connections play a somewhat lesser role in Greece than in many other European countries, but they too have also been expanded, with new suburban/commuter rail connections, serviced by Proastiakos around Athens, towards its airport, Kiato and Chalkida; around Thessaloniki, towards the cities of Larissa and Edessa; and around Patras. A modern intercity rail connection between Athens and Thessaloniki has also been established, while an upgrade to double lines in many parts of the  network is underway; along with a new double track, standard gauge railway between Athens and Patras (replacing the old metre-gauge Piraeus–Patras railway) which is currently under construction and opening in stages. International railway lines connect Greek cities with the rest of Europe, the Balkans and Turkey.\\n\\nTelecommunications \\n\\nModern digital information and communication networks reach all areas. There are over  of fiber optics and an extensive open-wire network. Broadband internet availability is widespread in Greece: there were a total of 2,252,653 broadband connections , translating to 20% broadband penetration. According to 2017 data, around 82% of the general population used the internet regularly.\\n\\nInternet cafés that provide net access, office applications and multiplayer gaming are also a common sight in the country, while mobile internet on 3G and 4G- LTE cellphone networks and Wi-Fi connections can be found almost everywhere. 3G/4G mobile internet usage has been on a sharp increase in recent years. Based on 2016 data 70% of Greek internet users have access via 3G/4G mobile. The United Nations International Telecommunication Union ranks Greece among the top 30 countries with a highly developed information and communications infrastructure.\\n\\nScience and technology \\n\\nThe General Secretariat for Research and Technology of the Ministry of Development and Competitiveness is responsible for designing, implementing and supervising national research and technological policy. In 2017, spending on research and development (R&D) reached an all-time high of €2 billion, equal to 1.14 percent of GDP.\\n\\nAlthough lower than the EU average of 1.93 percent, between 1990 and 1998, total R&D expenditure in Greece enjoyed the third-highest increase in Europe, after Finland and Ireland. Greece was ranked 43rd in the Global Innovation Index in 2020, down from 41st in 2019. Because of its strategic location, qualified workforce, and political and economic stability, many multinational companies such as Ericsson, Siemens, Motorola, Coca-Cola, and Tesla have their regional R&D headquarters in Greece.\\n\\nGreece has several major technology parks with incubator facilities and has been a member of the European Space Agency (ESA) since 2005. Cooperation between ESA and the Hellenic National Space Committee began in 1994 with the signing of the first cooperation agreement. After applying for full membership in 2003, Greece became the ESA\\'s sixteenth member on 16 March 2005. The country participates in the ESA\\'s telecommunication and technology activities and the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Initiative.\\n\\nThe National Centre of Scientific Research \"Demokritos\" was founded in 1959. The original objective of the center was the advancement of nuclear research and technology. Today, its activities cover several fields of science and engineering.\\n\\nGreece has one of the highest rates of tertiary enrollment in the world, while Greeks are well represented in academia worldwide; numerous leading Western universities employ a disproportionately high number of Greek faculty. Greek scientific publications have grown significantly in terms of research impact, surpassing both the EU and global average from 2012 to 2016.\\n\\nNotable Greek scientists of modern times include Georgios Papanikolaou (inventor of the Pap test), mathematician Constantin Carathéodory (known for the Carathéodory theorems and Carathéodory conjecture), astronomer E. M. Antoniadi, archaeologists Ioannis Svoronos, Valerios Stais, Spyridon Marinatos, Manolis Andronikos (discovered the tomb of Philip II of Macedon in Vergina), Indologist Dimitrios Galanos, botanist Theodoros G. Orphanides, such as Michael Dertouzos, Nicholas Negroponte, John Argyris, John Iliopoulos (2007 Dirac Prize for his contributions on the physics of the charm quark, a major contribution to the birth of the Standard Model, the modern theory of Elementary Particles), Joseph Sifakis (2007 Turing Award, the \"Nobel Prize\" of Computer Science), Christos Papadimitriou (2002 Knuth Prize, 2012 Gödel Prize), Mihalis Yannakakis (2005 Knuth Prize) and physicist Dimitri Nanopoulos.\\n\\nDemographics \\n\\nAccording to the official statistical body of Greece, the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT), the country\\'s total population in 2011 was 10,816,286. Eurostat places the current population at 10.7 million in 2018.\\n\\nGreek society has changed rapidly over the last several decades, coinciding with the wider European trend of declining fertility and rapid aging. The birth rate in 2003 stood at 9.5 per 1,000 inhabitants, significantly lower than the rate of 14.5 per 1,000 in 1981. At the same time, the mortality rate increased slightly from 8.9 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 to 9.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2003. Estimates from 2016 show the birth rate decreasing further still to 8.5 per 1,000 and mortality climbing to 11.2 per 1,000.\\n\\n \\nThe fertility rate of 1.41 children per woman is well below the replacement rate of 2.1, and is one of the lowest in the world, considerably below the high of 5.47 children born per woman in 1900. Subsequently, Greece\\'s median age is 44.2 years, the seventh-highest in the world. In 2001, 16.71 percent of the population were 65 years old and older, 68.12 percent between the ages of 15 and 64 years old, and 15.18 percent were 14 years old and younger. By 2016, the proportion of the population age 65 and older had risen to 20.68 percent, while the proportion of those aged 14 and younger declined to slightly below 14 percent.\\n\\nMarriage rates began declining from almost 71 per 1,000 inhabitants in 1981 until 2002, only to increase slightly in 2003 to 61 per 1,000 and then fall again to 51 in 2004. Moreover, divorce rates have seen an increase from 191.2 per 1,000 marriages in 1991 to 239.5 per 1,000 marriages in 2004.\\n\\nAs a result of these trends, the average Greek household is smaller and older than in previous generations. The economic crisis has exacerbated this development, with 350,000-450,000 Greeks, predominantly young adults, emigrating since 2010.\\n\\nCities \\n\\nAlmost two-thirds of the Greek people live in urban areas. Greece\\'s largest and most influential metropolitan centres are those of Athens and Thessaloniki—that latter commonly referred to as the  (, )—with metropolitan populations of approximately 4 million and 1 million inhabitants respectively. Other prominent cities with urban populations above 100,000 inhabitants include Patras, Heraklion, Larissa, Volos, Rhodes, Ioannina, Agrinio, Chania, and Chalcis.\\n\\nThe table below lists the largest cities in Greece, by population contained in their respective contiguous built up urban areas, which are either made up of many municipalities, evident in the cases of Athens and Thessaloniki, or are contained within a larger single municipality, case evident in most of the smaller cities of the country. The results come from the preliminary figures of the population census that took place in Greece in May 2011.\\n\\nReligion \\n\\nThe Greek Constitution recognises Eastern Orthodoxy as the \\'prevailing\\' faith of the country, while guaranteeing freedom of religious belief for all. The Greek government does not keep statistics on religious groups and censuses do not ask for religious affiliation. According to the U.S. State Department, an estimated 97% of Greek citizens identify themselves as Eastern Orthodox, belonging to the Greek Orthodox Church, which uses the Byzantine rite and the Greek language, the original language of the New Testament. The administration of the Greek territory is shared between the Church of Greece and the Patriarchate of Constantinople.\\n\\nIn a 2010 Eurostat–Eurobarometer poll, 79% of Greek citizens responded that they \"believe there is a God\". According to other sources, 15.8% of Greeks describe themselves as \"very religious\", which is the highest among all European countries. The survey also found that just 3.5% never attend a church, compared to 4.9% in Poland and 59.1% in the Czech Republic.\\n\\nEstimates of the recognised Greek Muslim minority, which is mostly located in Thrace, range around 100,000, (about 1% of the population). Some of the Albanian immigrants to Greece come from a nominally Muslim background, although most are secular in orientation. Following the 1919–1922 Greco-Turkish War and the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne, Greece and Turkey agreed to a population transfer based on cultural and religious identity. About 500,000 Muslims from Greece, predominantly those defined as Turks, but also Greek Muslims like the Vallahades of western Macedonia, were exchanged with approximately 1.5 million Greeks from Turkey. However, many refugees who settled in former Ottoman Muslim villages in Central Macedonia, and were defined as Christian Orthodox Caucasus Greeks, arrived from the former Russian Transcaucasus province of Kars Oblast, after it had been retroceded to Turkey prior to the official population exchange.\\n\\nJudaism has been present in Greece for more than 2,000 years.\\nThe ancient community of Greek Jews are called Romaniotes, while the Sephardi Jews were once a prominent community in the city of Thessaloniki, numbering some 80,000, or more than half of the population, by 1900. However, after the German occupation of Greece and the Holocaust during World War II, is estimated to number around 5,500 people.\\n\\nThe Roman Catholic community is estimated to be around 250,000 of which 50,000 are Greek citizens. Their community is nominally separate from the smaller Greek Byzantine Catholic Church, which recognises the primacy of the Pope but maintains the liturgy of the Byzantine Rite. Old Calendarists account for 500,000 followers. Protestants, including the Greek Evangelical Church and Free Evangelical Churches, stand at about 30,000. Other Christian minorities, such as Assemblies of God, International Church of the Foursquare Gospel and various Pentecostal churches of the Greek Synod of Apostolic Church total about 12,000 members. The independent Free Apostolic Church of Pentecost is the biggest Protestant denomination in Greece with 120 churches. There are no official statistics about Free Apostolic Church of Pentecost, but the Orthodox Church estimates the followers as 20,000. The Jehovah\\'s Witnesses report having 28,874 active members.\\n\\nSince 2017, Hellenic Polytheism, or Helenism has been legally recognised as an actively practiced religion in Greece, with estimates of 2,000 active practitioners and an additional 100,000 \"sympathisers\". Hellenism refers to various religious movements that continue, revive, or reconstruct ancient Greek religious practices.\\n\\nLanguages \\n\\nThe first textual evidence of the Greek language dates back to the 15th century BC and the Linear B script which is associated with the Mycenaean Civilization. Greek was a widely spoken lingua franca in the Mediterranean world and beyond during Classical Antiquity, and would eventually become the official parlance of the Byzantine Empire.\\n\\nDuring the 19th and 20th centuries there was a major dispute known as the Greek language question, on whether the official language of Greece should be the archaic Katharevousa, created in the 19th century and used as the state and scholarly language, or the Dimotiki, the form of the Greek language which evolved naturally from Byzantine Greek and was the language of the people. The dispute was finally resolved in 1976, when Dimotiki was made the only official variation of the Greek language, and Katharevousa fell to disuse.\\n\\nGreece is today relatively homogeneous in linguistic terms, with a large majority of the native population using Greek as their first or only language. Among the Greek-speaking population, speakers of the distinctive Pontic dialect came to Greece from Asia Minor after the Greek genocide and constitute a sizable group. The Cappadocian dialect came to Greece due to the genocide as well, but is endangered and is barely spoken now. Indigenous Greek dialects include the archaic Greek spoken by the Sarakatsani, traditionally transhument mountain shepherds of Greek Macedonia and other parts of Northern Greece. The Tsakonian language, a distinct Greek language deriving from Doric Greek instead of Koine Greek, is still spoken in some villages in the southeastern Peloponnese.\\n\\nThe Muslim minority in Thrace, which amounts to approximately 0.95% of the total population, consists of speakers of Turkish, Bulgarian (Pomaks) and Romani. Romani is also spoken by Christian Roma in other parts of the country. Further minority languages have traditionally been spoken by regional population groups in various parts of the country. Their use has decreased radically in the course of the 20th century through assimilation with the Greek-speaking majority.\\n\\nToday they are only maintained by the older generations and are on the verge of extinction. This goes for the Arvanites, an Albanian-speaking group mostly located in the rural areas around the capital Athens, and for the Aromanians and Megleno-Romanians, also known as \"Vlachs\", whose language is closely related to Romanian and who used to live scattered across several areas of mountainous central Greece. Members of these groups usually identify ethnically as Greek and are today all at least bilingual in Greek.\\n\\nNear the northern Greek borders there are also some Slavic–speaking groups, locally known as Slavomacedonian-speaking, most of whose members identify ethnically as Greeks. It is estimated that after the population exchanges of 1923, Macedonia had 200,000 to 400,000 Slavic speakers. The Jewish community in Greece traditionally spoke Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), today maintained only by a few thousand speakers. Other notable minority languages include Armenian, Georgian, and the Greco-Turkic dialect spoken by the Urums, a community of Caucasus Greeks from the Tsalka region of central Georgia and ethnic Greeks from southeastern Ukraine who arrived in mainly Northern Greece as economic migrants in the 1990s.\\n\\nMigration \\n\\nThroughout the 20th century, millions of Greeks migrated to the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and Germany, creating a large Greek diaspora. Net migration started to show positive numbers from the 1970s, but until the beginning of the 1990s, the main influx was that of returning Greek migrants or of Pontic Greeks and others from Russia, Georgia, Turkey the Czech Republic, and elsewhere in the former Soviet Bloc.\\n\\nA study from the Mediterranean Migration Observatory maintains that the 2001 census recorded 762,191 persons residing in Greece without Greek citizenship, constituting around 7% of the total population. Of the non-citizen residents, 48,560 were EU or European Free Trade Association nationals and 17,426 were Cypriots with privileged status. The majority come from Eastern European countries: Albania (56%), Bulgaria (5%) and Romania (3%), while migrants from the former Soviet Union (Georgia, Russia, Ukraine, Moldova, etc.) comprise 10% of the total. Some of the immigrants from Albania are from the Greek minority in Albania centred on the region of Northern Epirus. In addition, the total Albanian national population which includes temporary migrants and undocumented persons is around 600,000.\\n\\nThe 2011 census recorded 9,903,268 Greek citizens (91,56%), 480,824 Albanian citizens (4,44%), 75,915 Bulgarian citizens (0,7%), 46,523 Romanian citizenship (0,43%), 34,177 Pakistani citizens (0,32%), 27,400 Georgian citizens (0,25%) and 247,090 people had other or unidentified citizenship (2,3%). 189,000 people of the total population of Albanian citizens were reported in 2008 as ethnic Greeks from Southern Albania, in the historical region of Northern Epirus.\\n\\nThe greatest cluster of non-EU immigrant population are the larger urban centers, especially the Municipality of Athens, with 132,000 immigrants comprising 17% of the local population, and then Thessaloniki, with 27,000 immigrants reaching 7% of the local population. There is also a considerable number of co-ethnics that came from the Greek communities of Albania and the former Soviet Union.\\n\\nGreece, together with Italy and Spain, is a major entry point for illegal immigrants trying to enter the EU. Illegal immigrants entering Greece mostly do so from the border with Turkey at the Evros River and the islands of the eastern Aegean across from Turkey (mainly Lesbos, Chios, Kos, and Samos). In 2012, the majority of illegal immigrants entering Greece came from Afghanistan, followed by Pakistanis and Bangladeshis. In 2015, arrivals of refugees by sea had increased dramatically mainly due to the ongoing Syrian civil war. There were 856,723 arrivals by sea in Greece, an almost fivefold increase to the same period of 2014, of which the Syrians represent almost 45%. The majority of refugees and migrants use Greece as a transit country, while their intended destinations are northern European Nations such as Austria, Germany and Sweden.\\n\\nEducation \\n\\nGreeks have a long tradition of valuing and investing in paideia (education), which was upheld as one of the highest societal values in the Greek and Hellenistic world. The first European institution described as a university was founded in fifth-century Constantinople and continued operating in various incarnations until the city\\'s fall to the Ottomans in 1453. The University of Constantinople was Christian Europe\\'s first secular institution of higher learning, and by some measures was the world\\'s first university.\\n\\nCompulsory education in Greece comprises primary schools (Δημοτικό Σχολείο, Dimotikó Scholeio) and gymnasium (Γυμνάσιο). Nursery schools (Παιδικός σταθμός, Paidikós Stathmós) are popular but not compulsory. Kindergartens (Νηπιαγωγείο, Nipiagogeío) are now compulsory for any child above four years of age. Children start primary school aged six and remain there for six years. Attendance at gymnasia starts at age 12 and lasts for three years.\\n\\nGreece\\'s post-compulsory secondary education consists of two school types: unified upper secondary schools (Γενικό Λύκειο, Genikό Lykeiό) and technical–vocational educational schools (Τεχνικά και Επαγγελματικά Εκπαιδευτήρια, \"TEE\"). Post-compulsory secondary education also includes vocational training institutes (Ινστιτούτα Επαγγελματικής Κατάρτισης, \"IEK\") which provide a formal but unclassified level of education. As they can accept both Gymnasio (lower secondary school) and Lykeio (upper secondary school) graduates, these institutes are not classified as offering a particular level of education.\\n\\nAccording to the Framework Law (3549/2007), Public higher education \"Highest Educational Institutions\" (Ανώτατα Εκπαιδευτικά Ιδρύματα, Anótata Ekpaideytiká Idrýmata, \"ΑΕΙ\") consists of two parallel sectors:the university sector (Universities, Polytechnics, Fine Arts Schools, the Open University) and the Technological sector (Technological Education Institutions (TEI) and the School of Pedagogic and Technological Education). There are also State Non-University Tertiary Institutes offering vocationally oriented courses of shorter duration (2 to 3 years) which operate under the authority of other Ministries. Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place after completion of the third grade of Lykeio. Additionally, students over twenty-two years old may be admitted to the Hellenic Open University through a form of lottery. The Capodistrian University of Athens is the oldest university in the eastern Mediterranean.\\n\\nThe Greek education system also provides special kindergartens, primary, and secondary schools for people with special needs or difficulties in learning. There are also specialist gymnasia and high schools offering musical, theological, and physical education.\\n\\nSeventy-two percent of Greek adults aged 25–64 have completed upper secondary education, which is slightly less than the OECD average of 74 percent. The average Greek pupil scored 458 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD\\'s 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). This score is lower than the OECD average of 486. On average, girls outperformed boys by 15 points, much more than the average OECD gap of two points.\\n\\nHealthcare system \\n\\nGreece has universal health care. The system is mixed, combining a national health service with social health insurance (SHI). 2000 World Health Organization report, its health care system ranked 14th in overall performance of 191 countries surveyed. In a 2013 Save the Children report, Greece was ranked the 19th out of 176 countries for the state of mothers and newborn babies. In 2010, there were 138 hospitals with 31,000 beds, but in 2011, the Ministry of Health announced plans to decrease the number to 77 hospitals with 36,035 beds to reduce expenses and further enhance healthcare standards. However, as of 2014, there were 124 public hospitals, of which 106 were general hospitals and 18 specialised hospitals, with a total capacity of about 30,000 beds.\\n\\nGreece\\'s healthcare expenditures as a percentage of GDP were 9.6% in 2007, just above the OECD average of 9.5%. By 2015, spending declined to 8.4% of GDP (compared with the EU average of 9.5%), a decline of one-fifth since 2010. Nevertheless, the country maintains the highest doctor-to-population ratio of any OECD country and the highest doctor-to-patient ratio in the EU.\\n\\nLife expectancy in Greece is among the highest in the world; a 2011 OECD report placed it at 80.3 years, above the OECD average of 79.5, while a more recent 2017 study found life expectancy in 2015 to be 81.1 years, slightly above the EU average of 80.6. The island of Icaria has the highest percentage of nonagenarians in the world; approximately 33% of islanders are 90 or older. Icaria is subsequently classified as a \"blue zone\", a region where people allegedly live longer than average and have lower rates of cancer, heart disease, or other chronic illnesses.\\n\\nThe 2011 OECD report showed that Greece had the largest percentage of adult daily smokers of any of the 34 OECD members. The country\\'s obesity rate is 18.1%, which is above the OECD average of 15.1%, but considerably lower than the American rate of 27.7%. In 2008, Greece had the highest rate of perceived good health in the OECD, at 98.5%. Infant mortality, with a rate of 3.6 deaths per 1,000 live births, was below the 2007 OECD average of 4.9.\\n\\nCulture \\n\\nThe culture of Greece has evolved over thousands of years, beginning in Mycenaean Greece and continuing most notably into Classical Greece, through the influence of the Roman Empire and its Greek Eastern continuation, the Eastern Roman or Byzantine Empire. Other cultures and nations, such as the Latin and Frankish states, the Ottoman Empire, the Venetian Republic, the Genoese Republic, and the British Empire have also left their influence on modern Greek culture, although historians credit the Greek War of Independence with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single, cohesive entity of its multi-faceted culture.\\n\\nIn ancient times, Greece was the birthplace of Western culture. Modern democracies owe a debt to Greek beliefs in government by the people, trial by jury, and equality under the law. The ancient Greeks pioneered in many fields that rely on systematic thought, including logic, biology, geometry, geography, medicine, history, philosophy, physics and mathematics. They introduced such important literary forms as epic and lyric poetry, history, tragedy, comedy and drama. In their pursuit of order and proportion, the Greeks created an ideal of beauty that strongly influenced Western art.\\n\\nVisual arts \\n\\nArtistic production in Greece began in the prehistoric pre-Greek Cycladic and the Minoan civilizations, both of which were influenced by local traditions and the art of ancient Egypt.\\n\\nThere were several interconnected traditions of painting in ancient Greece. Due to their technical differences, they underwent somewhat differentiated developments. Not all painting techniques are equally well represented in the archaeological record. The most respected form of art, according to authors like Pliny or Pausanias, were individual, mobile paintings on wooden boards, technically described as panel paintings. Also, the tradition of wall painting in Greece goes back at least to the Minoan and Mycenaean Bronze Age, with the lavish fresco decoration of sites like Knossos, Tiryns and Mycenae. Much of the figural or architectural sculpture of ancient Greece was painted colourfully. This aspect of Greek stonework is described as polychrome.\\n\\nAncient Greek sculpture was composed almost entirely of marble or bronze; with cast bronze becoming the favoured medium for major works by the early 5th century. Both marble and bronze are easy to form and very durable. Chryselephantine sculptures, used for temple cult images and luxury works, used gold, most often in leaf form and ivory for all or parts (faces and hands) of the figure, and probably gems and other materials, but were much less common, and only fragments have survived. By the early 19th century, the systematic excavation of ancient Greek sites had brought forth a plethora of sculptures with traces of notably multicolored surfaces. It was not until published findings by German archaeologist Vinzenz Brinkmann in the late 20th century, that the painting of ancient Greek sculptures became an established fact.\\n\\nThe art production continued also during the Byzantine era. The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its \"abstract\", or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favour of a more symbolic approach. The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on icons and hagiographies. The Macedonian art (Byzantine) was the artistic expression of Macedonian Renaissance, a label sometimes used to describe the period of the Macedonian dynasty of the Byzantine Empire (867–1056), especially the 10th century, which some scholars have seen as a time of increased interest in classical scholarship and the assimilation of classical motifs into Christian artwork.\\n\\nPost Byzantine art schools include the Cretan School and Heptanese School. The first artistic movement in the Greek Kingdom can be considered the Greek academic art of the 19th century (Munich School). Notable modern Greek painters include Nikolaos Gyzis, Georgios Jakobides, Theodoros Vryzakis, Nikiforos Lytras, Konstantinos Volanakis, Nikos Engonopoulos and Yannis Tsarouchis, while some notable sculptors are Pavlos Prosalentis, Ioannis Kossos, Leonidas Drosis, Georgios Bonanos and Yannoulis Chalepas.\\n\\nArchitecture \\n\\nThe architecture of ancient Greece was produced by the ancient Greeks (Hellenes), whose culture flourished on the Greek mainland, the Aegean Islands and their colonies, for a period from about 900 BC until the 1st century AD, with the earliest remaining architectural works dating from around 600 BC. The formal vocabulary of ancient Greek architecture, in particular the division of architectural style into three defined orders: the Doric Order, the Ionic Order and the Corinthian Order, was to have profound effect on Western architecture of later periods.\\n\\nByzantine architecture is the architecture promoted by the Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, which dominated Greece and the Greek speaking world during the Middle Ages. The empire endured for more than a millennium, dramatically influencing Medieval architecture throughout Europe and the Near East, and becoming the primary progenitor of the Renaissance and Ottoman architectural traditions that followed its collapse.\\n\\nAfter the Greek Independence, the modern Greek architects tried to combine traditional Greek and Byzantine elements and motives with the western European movements and styles. Patras was the first city of the modern Greek state to develop a city plan. In January 1829, Stamatis Voulgaris, a Greek engineer of the French army, presented the plan of the new city to the Governor Kapodistrias, who approved it. Voulgaris applied the orthogonal rule in the urban complex of Patras.\\n\\nTwo special genres can be considered the Cycladic architecture, featuring white-coloured houses, in the Cyclades and the Epirotic architecture in the region of Epirus. Important is also the influence of the Venetian style in the Ionian islands and the \"Mediterranean style\" of Florestano Di Fausto (during the years of the fascist regime) in the Dodecanese islands.\\n\\nAfter the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, the architecture of Athens and other cities was mostly influenced by the Neoclassical architecture. For Athens, the first King of Greece, Otto of Greece, commissioned the architects Stamatios Kleanthis and Eduard Schaubert to design a modern city plan fit for the capital of a state. As for Thessaloniki, after the fire of 1917, the government ordered for a new city plan under the supervision of Ernest Hébrard. Other modern Greek architects include Anastasios Metaxas, Lysandros Kaftanzoglou, Panagis Kalkos, Ernst Ziller, Xenophon Paionidis, Dimitris Pikionis and Georges Candilis.\\n\\nTheatre \\n\\nTheatre in its western form was born in Greece. The city-state of Classical Athens, which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its centre, where it was institutionalised as part of a festival called the Dionysia, which honoured the god Dionysus. Tragedy (late 6th century BC), comedy (486 BC), and the satyr play were the three dramatic genres to emerge there.\\n\\nDuring the Byzantine period, the theatrical art was heavily declined. According to Marios Ploritis, the only form survived was the folk theatre (Mimos and Pantomimos), despite the hostility of the official state. Later, during the Ottoman period, the main theatrical folk art was the Karagiozis. The renaissance which led to the modern Greek theatre, took place in the Venetian Crete. Significal dramatists include Vitsentzos Kornaros and Georgios Chortatzis.\\n\\nThe modern Greek theatre was born after the Greek independence, in the early 19th century, and initially was influenced by the Heptanesean theatre and melodrama, such as the Italian opera. The Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù was the first theatre and opera house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera, Spyridon Xyndas\\' The Parliamentary Candidate (based on an exclusively Greek libretto) was performed. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the Athenian theatre scene was dominated by revues, musical comedies, operettas and nocturnes and notable playwrights included Spyridon Samaras, Dionysios Lavrangas, Theophrastos Sakellaridis and others.\\n\\nThe National Theatre of Greece was opened in 1900 as Royal Theatre. Notable playwrights of the modern Greek theatre include Gregorios Xenopoulos, Nikos Kazantzakis, Pantelis Horn, Alekos Sakellarios and Iakovos Kambanelis, while notable actors include Cybele Andrianou, Marika Kotopouli, Aimilios Veakis, Orestis Makris, Katina Paxinou, Manos Katrakis and Dimitris Horn. Significant directors include Dimitris Rontiris, Alexis Minotis and Karolos Koun.\\n\\nLiterature \\n\\nGreek literature can be divided into three main categories: Ancient, Byzantine and modern Greek literature.\\n\\nAthens is considered the birthplace of Western literature. At the beginning of Greek literature stand the two monumental works of Homer: the Iliad and the Odyssey. Though dates of composition vary, these works were fixed around 800\\xa0BC or after. In the classical period many of the genres of western literature became more prominent. Lyrical poetry, odes, pastorals, elegies, epigrams; dramatic presentations of comedy and tragedy; historiography, rhetorical treatises, philosophical dialectics, and philosophical treatises all arose in this period. The two major lyrical poets were Sappho and Pindar. The Classical era also saw the dawn of drama.\\n\\nOf the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors have survived: those of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The surviving plays by Aristophanes are also a treasure trove of comic presentation, while Herodotus and Thucydides are two of the most influential historians in this period. The greatest prose achievement of the 4th century was in philosophy with the works of the three great philosophers.\\n\\nByzantine literature refers to literature of the Byzantine Empire written in Atticizing, Medieval and early Modern Greek, and it is the expression of the intellectual life of the Byzantine Greeks during the Christian Middle Ages. Although popular Byzantine literature and early Modern Greek literature both began in the 11th century, the two are indistinguishable.\\n\\nModern Greek literature refers to literature written in common Modern Greek, emerging from late Byzantine times in the 11th century. The Cretan Renaissance poem Erotokritos is considered the masterpiece of this period of Greek literature. It is a verse romance written around 1600 by Vitsentzos Kornaros (1553–1613). Later, during the period of Greek enlightenment (Diafotismos), writers such as Adamantios Korais and Rigas Feraios prepared with their works the Greek Revolution (1821–1830).\\n\\nLeading figures of modern Greek literature include Dionysios Solomos, Andreas Kalvos, Angelos Sikelianos, Emmanuel Rhoides, Demetrius Vikelas, Kostis Palamas, Penelope Delta, Yannis Ritsos, Alexandros Papadiamantis, Nikos Kazantzakis, Andreas Embeirikos, Kostas Karyotakis, Gregorios Xenopoulos, Constantine P. Cavafy, Nikos Kavvadias, Kostas Varnalis and Kiki Dimoula. Two Greek authors have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature: George Seferis in 1963 and Odysseas Elytis in 1979.\\n\\nPhilosophy \\n\\nMost western philosophical traditions began in Ancient Greece in the 6th century BC. The first philosophers are called \"Presocratics,\" which designates that they came before Socrates, whose contributions mark a turning point in western thought. The Presocratics were from the western or the eastern colonies of Greece and only fragments of their original writings survive, in some cases merely a single sentence.\\n\\nA new period of philosophy started with Socrates. Like the Sophists, he rejected entirely the physical speculations in which his predecessors had indulged, and made the thoughts and opinions of people his starting-point. Aspects of Socrates were first united from Plato, who also combined with them many of the principles established by earlier philosophers, and developed the whole of this material into the unity of a comprehensive system.\\n\\nAristotle of Stagira, the most important disciple of Plato, shared with his teacher the title of the greatest philosopher of antiquity. But while Plato had sought to elucidate and explain things from the supra-sensual standpoint of the forms, his pupil preferred to start from the facts given to us by experience. Except from these three most significant Greek philosophers other known schools of Greek philosophy from other founders during ancient times were Stoicism, Epicureanism, Skepticism and Neoplatonism.\\n\\nByzantine philosophy refers to the distinctive philosophical ideas of the philosophers and scholars of the Byzantine Empire, especially between the 8th and 15th centuries. It was characterised by a Christian world-view, but one which could draw ideas directly from the Greek texts of Plato, Aristotle, and the Neoplatonists.\\n\\nOn the eve of the Fall of Constantinople, Gemistus Pletho tried to restore the use of the term \"Hellene\" and advocated the return to the Olympian Gods of the ancient world. After 1453 a number of Greek Byzantine scholars who fled to western Europe contributed to the Renaissance.\\n\\nIn modern period, Diafotismos (Greek: Διαφωτισμός, \"enlightenment\", \"illumination\") was the Greek expression of the Age of Enlightenment and its philosophical and political ideas. Some notable representatives were Adamantios Korais, Rigas Feraios and Theophilos Kairis.\\n\\nOther modern era Greek philosophers or political scientists include Cornelius Castoriadis, Nicos Poulantzas and Christos Yannaras.\\n\\nMusic and dances \\n\\nGreek vocal music extends far back into ancient times where mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration and spiritual reasons. Instruments during that period included the double-reed aulos and the plucked string instrument, the lyre, especially the special kind called a kithara. Music played an important role in the education system during ancient times. Boys were taught music from the age of six. Later influences from the Roman Empire, Middle East, and the Byzantine Empire also had effect on Greek music.\\n\\nWhile the new technique of polyphony was developing in the West, the Eastern Orthodox Church resisted any type of change. Therefore, Byzantine music remained monophonic and without any form of instrumental accompaniment. As a result, and despite certain attempts by certain Greek chanters (such as Manouel Gazis, Ioannis Plousiadinos or the Cypriot Ieronimos o Tragoudistis), Byzantine music was deprived of elements of which in the West encouraged an unimpeded development of art. However, this method which kept music away from polyphony, along with centuries of continuous culture, enabled monophonic music to develop to the greatest heights of perfection. Byzantium presented the monophonic Byzantine chant; a melodic treasury of inestimable value for its rhythmical variety and expressive power.\\n\\nAlong with the Byzantine (Church) chant and music, the Greek people also cultivated the Greek folk song (Demotiko) which is divided into two cycles, the akritic and klephtic. The akritic was created between the 9th and 10th centuries and expressed the life and struggles of the akrites (frontier guards) of the Byzantine empire, the most well known being the stories associated with Digenes Akritas. The klephtic cycle came into being between the late Byzantine period and the start of the Greek War of Independence. The klephtic cycle, together with historical songs, paraloghes (narrative song or ballad), love songs, mantinades, wedding songs, songs of exile and dirges express the life of the Greeks. There is a unity between the Greek people\\'s struggles for freedom, their joys and sorrow and attitudes towards love and death.\\n\\nThe Heptanesean kantádhes (καντάδες \\'serenades\\'; sing.: καντάδα) became the forerunners of the Greek modern urban popular song, influencing its development to a considerable degree. For the first part of the next century, several Greek composers continued to borrow elements from the Heptanesean style. The most successful songs during the period 1870–1930 were the so-called Athenian serenades, and the songs performed on stage (επιθεωρησιακά τραγούδια \\'theatrical revue songs\\') in revue, operettas and nocturnes that were dominating Athens\\' theater scene.\\n\\nRebetiko, initially a music associated with the lower classes, later (and especially after the population exchange between Greece and Turkey) reached greater general acceptance as the rough edges of its overt subcultural character were softened and polished, sometimes to the point of unrecognizability. It was the base of the later laïkó (song of the people). The leading performers of the genre include Vassilis Tsitsanis, Grigoris Bithikotsis, Stelios Kazantzidis, George Dalaras, Haris Alexiou and Glykeria.\\n\\nRegarding the classical music, it was through the Ionian islands (which were under western rule and influence) that all the major advances of the western European classical music were introduced to mainland Greeks. The region is notable for the birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music (Heptanesean or Ionian School, Greek: Επτανησιακή Σχολή), established in 1815. Prominent representatives of this genre include Nikolaos Mantzaros, Spyridon Xyndas, Spyridon Samaras and Pavlos Carrer. Manolis Kalomiris is considered the founder of the Greek National School of Music.\\n\\nIn the 20th century, Greek composers have had a significant impact on the development of avant garde and modern classical music, with figures such as Iannis Xenakis, Nikos Skalkottas, and Dimitri Mitropoulos achieving international prominence. At the same time, composers and musicians such as Mikis Theodorakis, Manos Hatzidakis, Eleni Karaindrou, Vangelis and Demis Roussos garnered an international following for their music, which include famous film scores such as Zorba the Greek, Serpico, Never on Sunday, America America, Eternity and a Day, Chariots of Fire, Blade Runner, among others. Greek American composers known for their film scores include also Yanni and Basil Poledouris. Notable Greek opera singers and classical musicians of the 20th and 21st century include Maria Callas, Nana Mouskouri, Mario Frangoulis, Leonidas Kavakos, Dimitris Sgouros and others.\\n\\nDuring the dictatorship of the Colonels, the music of Mikis Theodorakis was banned by the junta and the composer was jailed, internally exiled, and put in a concentration camp, before finally being allowed to leave Greece due to international reaction to his detention. Released during the junta years, Anthrope Agapa, ti Fotia Stamata (Make Love, Stop the Gunfire), by the pop group Poll is considered the first anti-war protest song in the history of Greek rock. The song was echoing the hippie slogan Make love, not war and was inspired directly by the Vietnam War, becoming a \"smash hit\" in Greece.\\n\\nGreece participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 35 times after its debut at the 1974 Contest. In 2005, Greece won with the song \"My Number One\", performed by Greek-Swedish singer Elena Paparizou. The song received 230 points with 10 sets of 12 points from Belgium, Bulgaria, Hungary, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Albania, Cyprus, Serbia & Montenegro, Sweden and Germany and also became a smash hit in different countries and especially in Greece. The 51st Eurovision Song Contest was held in Athens at the Olympic Indoor Hall of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Maroussi, with hosted by Maria Menounos and Sakis Rouvas.\\n\\nCuisine \\n\\nGreek cuisine is characteristic of the Mediterranean diet, which is epitomised by dishes of Crete. Greek cuisine incorporates fresh ingredients into a variety of local dishes such as moussaka, pastitsio, classic Greek salad, fasolada, spanakopita and souvlaki. Some dishes can be traced back to ancient Greece like skordalia (a thick purée of walnuts, almonds, crushed garlic and olive oil), lentil soup, retsina (white or rosé wine sealed with pine resin) and pasteli (candy bar with sesame seeds baked with honey). Throughout Greece people often enjoy eating from small dishes such as meze with various dips such as tzatziki, grilled octopus and small fish, feta cheese, dolmades (rice, currants and pine kernels wrapped in vine leaves), various pulses, olives and cheese. Olive oil is added to almost every dish.\\n\\nSome sweet desserts include melomakarona, diples and galaktoboureko, and drinks such as ouzo, metaxa and a variety of wines including retsina. Greek cuisine differs widely from different parts of the mainland and from island to island. It uses some flavorings more often than other Mediterranean cuisines: oregano, mint, garlic, onion, dill and bay laurel leaves. Other common herbs and spices include basil, thyme and fennel seed. Many Greek recipes, especially in the northern parts of the country, use \"sweet\" spices in combination with meat, for example cinnamon and cloves in stews.\\n\\nKoutouki, or Koutoukian, are an underground restaurant common in Greece.\\n\\nCinema \\n\\nCinema first appeared in Greece in 1896, but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907 in Athens. In 1914, the Asty Films Company was founded and the production of long films began. Golfo (Γκόλφω), a well known traditional love story, is considered the first Greek feature film, although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931, Orestis Laskos directed Daphnis and Chloe (Δάφνις και Χλόη), containing one of the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad. In 1944, Katina Paxinou was honoured with the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for For Whom the Bell Tolls.\\n\\nThe 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many to be a \"golden age\" of Greek cinema.

During the parade of nations, Greece is always called first, as the founding nation of the ancient precursor of modern Olympics. The nation has competed at every Summer Olympic Games, one of only four countries to have done so. Having won a total of 110 medals (30 gold, 42 silver and 38 bronze), Greece is ranked 32nd by gold medals in the all-time Summer Olympic medal count. Their best ever performance was in the 1896 Summer Olympics, when Greece finished second in the medal table with 10 gold medals.\\n\\nThe Greek national football team, ranking 12th in the world in 2014 (and having reached a high of 8th in the world in 2008 and 2011), were crowned European Champions in Euro 2004 in one of the biggest upsets in the history of the sport. The Greek Super League is the highest professional football league in the country, comprising fourteen teams. The most successful are Olympiacos, Panathinaikos, and AEK Athens.\\n\\nThe Greek national basketball team has a decades-long tradition of excellence in the sport, being considered among the world\\'s top basketball powers. , it ranked 4th in the world and 2nd in Europe. They have won the European Championship twice in 1987 and 2005, and have reached the final four in two of the last four FIBA World Championships, taking the second place in the world in 2006 FIBA World Championship, after a 101–95 win against Team USA in the tournament\\'s semifinal. The domestic top basketball league, A1 Ethniki, is composed of fourteen teams. The most successful Greek teams are Panathinaikos, Olympiacos, Aris Thessaloniki, AEK Athens and P.A.O.K. Greek basketball teams are the most successful in European basketball the last 25 years, having won 9 Euroleagues since the establishment of the modern era Euroleague Final Four format in 1988, while no other nation has won more than 4 Euroleague championships in this period. Besides the 9 Euroleagues, Greek basketball teams (Panathinaikos, Olympiacos, Aris Thessaloniki, AEK Athens, P.A.O.K, Maroussi) have won 3 Triple Crowns, 5 Saporta Cups, 2 Korać Cups and 1 FIBA Europe Champions Cup. After the 2005 European Championship triumph of the Greek national basketball team, Greece became the reigning European Champion in both football and basketball.\\n\\nThe Greece women\\'s national water polo team have emerged as one of the leading powers in the world, becoming World Champions after their gold medal win against the hosts China at the 2011 World Championship. They also won the silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics, the gold medal at the 2005 World League and the silver medals at the 2010 and 2012 European Championships. The Greece men\\'s national water polo team became the third best water polo team in the world in 2005, after their win against Croatia in the bronze medal game at the 2005 World Aquatics Championships in Canada. The domestic top water polo leagues, Greek Men\\'s Water Polo League and Greek Women\\'s Water Polo League are considered amongst the top national leagues in European water polo, as its clubs have made significant success in European competitions. In men\\'s European competitions, Olympiacos has won the Champions League, the European Super Cup and the Triple Crown in 2002 becoming the first club in water polo history to win every title in which it has competed within a single year (National championship, National cup, Champions League and European Super Cup), while NC Vouliagmeni has won the LEN Cup Winners\\' Cup in 1997. In women\\'s European competitions, Greek water polo teams (NC Vouliagmeni, Glyfada NSC, Olympiacos, Ethnikos Piraeus) are amongst the most successful in European water polο, having won 4 LEN Champions Cups, 3 LEN Trophies and 2 European Supercups.\\n\\nThe Greek men\\'s national volleyball team has won two bronze medals, one in the European Volleyball Championship and another one in the Men\\'s European Volleyball League, a 5th place in the Olympic Games and a 6th place in the FIVB Volleyball Men\\'s World Championship. The Greek league, the A1 Ethniki, is considered one of the top volleyball leagues in Europe and the Greek clubs have had significant success in European competitions. Olympiacos is the most successful volleyball club in the country having won the most domestic titles and being the only Greek club to have won European titles; they have won two CEV Cups, they have been CEV Champions League runners-up twice and they have played in 12 Final Fours in the European competitions, making them one of the most traditional volleyball clubs in Europe. Iraklis have also seen significant success in European competitions, having been three times runners-up of the CEV Champions League.\\n\\nIn handball, AC Diomidis Argous is the only Greek club to have won a European Cup.\\n\\nApart from these, cricket is relatively popular in Corfu.\\n\\nMythology \\n\\nThe numerous gods of the ancient Greek religion as well as the mythical heroes and events of the ancient Greek epics (The Odyssey and The Iliad) and other pieces of art and literature from the time make up what is nowadays colloquially referred to as Greek mythology. Apart from serving a religious function, the mythology of the ancient Greek world also served a cosmological role as it was meant to try to explain how the world was formed and operated.\\n\\nThe principal gods of the ancient Greek religion were the Dodekatheon, or the Twelve Gods, who lived on the top of Mount Olympus. The most important of all ancient Greek gods was Zeus, the king of the gods, who was married to his sister, Hera. The other Greek gods that made up the Twelve Olympians were Ares, Poseidon, Athena, Demeter, Dionysus, Apollo, Artemis, Aphrodite, Hephaestus, and Hermes. Apart from these twelve gods, Greeks also had a variety of other mystical beliefs, such as nymphs and other magical creatures.\\n\\nPublic holidays and festivals \\n\\nAccording to Greek law, every Sunday of the year is a public holiday. Since the late \\'70s, Saturday also is a non-school and not working day. In addition, there are four mandatory official public holidays: 25 March (Greek Independence Day), Easter Monday, 15 August (Assumption or Dormition of the Holy Virgin), and 25 December (Christmas). 1 May (Labour Day) and 28 October (Ohi Day) are regulated by law as being optional but it is customary for employees to be given the day off. There are, however, more public holidays celebrated in Greece than are announced by the Ministry of Labour each year as either obligatory or optional. The list of these non-fixed national holidays rarely changes and has not changed in recent decades, giving a total of eleven national holidays each year.\\n\\nIn addition to the national holidays, there are public holidays that are not celebrated nationwide, but only by a specific professional group or a local community. For example, many municipalities have a \"Patron Saint\" parallel to \"Name Days\", or a \"Liberation Day\". On such days it is customary for schools to take the day off.\\n\\nNotable festivals, beyond the religious fests, include Patras Carnival, Athens Festival and various local wine festivals. The city of Thessaloniki is also home of a number of festivals and events. The Thessaloniki International Film Festival is one of the most important film festivals in Southern Europe.\\n\\nSee also \\n\\n Outline of Greece\\n Outline of ancient Greece\\n Index of Greece-related articles\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nCitations\\n\\nBibliography \\n\\n \"Minorities in Greece\\xa0– Historical Issues and New Perspectives\".

The first known mention is at the Medinet Habu temple which refers to the Peleset among those who fought against Egypt during Ramesses III\\'s reign, and the last known is 300 years later on Padiiset\\'s Statue. The Assyrians called the same region \"Palashtu/Palastu\" or \"Pilistu,\" beginning with Adad-nirari III in the Nimrud Slab in c. 800 BC through to an Esarhaddon treaty more than a century later. Neither the Egyptian nor the Assyrian sources provided clear regional boundaries for the term.\\n\\nThe term \"Palestine\" first appeared in the 5th century BC when the ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote of a \"district of Syria, called Palaistinê\" between Phoenicia and Egypt in The Histories. Herodotus applied the term to both the coastal and the inland regions such as the Judean mountains and the Jordan Rift Valley. Later Greek writers such as Aristotle, Polemon and Pausanias also used the word, which was followed by Roman writers such as Ovid, Tibullus, Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, Dio Chrysostom, Statius, Plutarch as well as Roman Judean writers Philo of Alexandria and Josephus. The word is not found on any Hellenistic coin or inscription, and is first known in official use in the early second century AD.\\n\\nIn 135 AD, the Greek \"Syria Palaestina\" was used in naming a new Roman province from the merger of Roman Syria and Roman Judaea after the Roman authorities crushed the Bar Kokhba Revolt. Circumstantial evidence links Hadrian to the renaming of the province, which took place around the same time as Jerusalem was refounded as Aelia Capitolina, but the precise date of the change in province name is uncertain. The common view that the name change was intended to \"sever the connection of the Jews to their historical homeland\" is disputed.\\n\\nAround the year 390, during the Byzantine period, the imperial province of Syria Palaestina was reorganized into Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda and Palaestina Salutaris. Following the Muslim conquest, place names that were in use by the Byzantine administration generally continued to be used in Arabic.\\n\\nThe use of the name \"Palestine\" became common in Early Modern English, was used in English and Arabic during the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem. The term was used widely as a self-identification by Palestinians from the end of the 19th century onwards. In the 20th century the name was used by the British to refer to \"Mandatory Palestine,\" a territory from the former Ottoman Empire which had been divided in the Sykes–Picot Agreement and secured by Britain via the Mandate for Palestine obtained from the League of Nations. Starting from 2013, the term was officially used in the eponymous \"State of Palestine.\" Both incorporated geographic regions from the land commonly known as Palestine, into a new state whose territory was named Palestine.\\n\\nEtymological considerations \\nThe English term \"Palestine\" itself derives from the Latin Palaestīna, which, in turn, derives from the Koine Greek Παλαιστῑ́νη, Palaistī́nē, used by the world\\'s first known historian, Herodotus, in the 5th century BCE. Per Martin Noth, the name likely comes from a proto-Semitic word, albeit there is a strong similarity between Palaistī́nē and palaistês, the Greek word for \"wrestler/rival/adversary\", which has the same etymological meaning as the Hebrew word \"Israel.\" This was expanded by David Jacobson to theorize the name being a portmanteau of the word for Philistines with a direct translation of the word Israel into Greek (in concordance with the Greek penchant for punning on place names.)\\n\\nWhilst the term was used in Egyptian and Assyrian times, prior to the time period in which the Bible is thought to have been written, scholars generally conclude that the term is cognate with the Biblical Hebrew  Pəlīštīm. The further etymology is uncertain; it is unknown whether the term was an endonym or exonym, no word for Philistia has been found in the sparse attestations of the Philistine language, and it is unknown whether the Hebrew, Egyptian, and Assyrian terms derived from a common source, or if they simply borrowed the name from one another and changed it to match their own phonological customs.\\n\\nIn English versions of the Bible, Pəlīštīm is translated as \"Philistines\"; however, it is thought that the word means different things in different parts of the Bible. The word and its derivates are used more than 250 times in Masoretic-derived versions of the Hebrew Bible, of which 10 uses are in the Torah (the first use being in Genesis 10, in the Generations of Noah), with undefined boundaries and no meaningful description, and almost 200 of the remaining references are in the later Book of Judges and the Books of Samuel that contain the well known story of a coastal state in biblical conflict with the Israelites. By the time the Septuagint was translated the term Palaistínē (Παλαιστίνη), first used by Herodotus, had already entered the Greek vocabulary. However, it was not used in the LXX – instead the term Land of Phylistieim (Γη των Φυλιστιειμ) is used. The Septuagint instead used the term \"allophuloi\" (Αλλόφυλοι, \"other nations\") throughout the Books of Judges and Samuel, such that the term \"Philistines\" has been interpreted to mean \"non-Israelites of the Promised Land\" when used in the context of Samson, Saul and David, and Rabbinic sources explain that these peoples were different from the Philistines of the Book of Genesis.\\n\\nHistorical references\\n\\nAncient period\\n\\nEgyptian period \\n\\n c. 1150 BC: Medinet Habu (temple): records a people called the P-r-s-t (conventionally Peleset) among those who fought against Egypt in Ramesses III\\'s reign.\\n c. 1150 BC: Papyrus Harris I: \"I extended all the boundaries of Egypt; I overthrew those who invaded them from their lands.

This part of Syria, and all the region extending from hence to Egypt, is known by the name of Palestine.\" One important reference refers to the practice of male circumcision associated with the Hebrew people: \"the Colchians, the Egyptians, and the Ethiopians, are the only nations who have practised circumcision from the earliest times. The Phoenicians and the Syrians of Palestine themselves confess that they learnt the custom of the Egyptians.... Now these are the only nations who use circumcision.\"\\n c. 340 BC: Aristotle, Meteorology, \"Again if, as is fabled, there is a lake in Palestine, such that if you bind a man or beast and throw it in it floats and does not sink, this would bear out what we have said.

It was established by the merge of Roman Syria and Roman Judaea, shortly before or after the Bar Kokhba Revolt. There is only circumstantial evidence linking Hadrian with the name change and the precise date is not certain. The common view that the name change was intended \"sever the connection of the Jews to their historical homeland\" is disputed. Zachary Foster in his doctoral dissertation wrote that \"Most scholars believe the Roman Emperor Hadrian changed the provincial administrative name of Judaea to Palestine to erase the Jewish presence in the land,\" opining that \"it’s equally likely the name change had little to do with Jew hatred and more to do with Hadrian’s romance with ancient Greece.\" He adds, there is a “paucity of direct evidence around who made the change, when and under what circumstances”, and that it may be that Hadrian did not “rename” the country but simply “called the place what it was called”. Louis Feldman argues prior to change of province name the term was used to refer to the coastal region associated with the Philistines and that first century authors differentiated Judea from Palestine.\\n 139: A Roman military diploma from Afiq names military units \"in Syria Palaestin[a].\"\\n c. 130: Pausanias (geographer), Description of Greece: (1) \"Hard by is a sanctuary of the Heavenly Aphrodite; the first men to establish her cult were the Assyrians, after the Assyrians the Paphians of Cyprus and the Phoenicians who live at Ascalon in Palestine; the Phoenicians taught her worship to the people of Cythera.\"; (2) \"In front of the sanctuary grow palm-trees, the fruit of which, though not wholly edible like the dates of Palestine, yet are riper than those of Ionia.\"; and (3) \"[a Hebrew Sibyl] brought up in Palestine named Sabbe, whose father was Berosus and her mother Erymanthe.

A diversity of religious systems divides them, as well as all the other nations on the earth, who give too much importance to the spirit of theological dispute.

Sometimes it has governors of its own, who reside at Gaza under the title of Pachas; but it is usually, as at present, divided into three appanages, or Melkana, viz. Yafa, Loudd, and Gaza. The former belongs to the Walda or sultana mother. The captain Pacha has received the two others as a recompence for his services, and a reward for the head of Daher. He farms them to an aga, who resides at Ramla, and pays him two hundred and fifteen purses for them, viz. one hundred and eighty for Gaza and Ramla, and thirty-five for Loudd. [...] The ground is tilled by asses or cows, rarely by oxen. In districts like Palestine, exposed to the Arabs, the countryman must sow with a musket in his hand. The corn before it changes colour, is reaped, but concealed in caverns. The whole industry of the peasant is limited to a supply of his immediate wants; and to procure a little bread, a few onions, a wretched blue shirt, and a bit of woollen, much labour is not necessary.\\n 1822: Conrad Malte-Brun, Universal Geography, Or, a Description of All the Parts of the World, on a New Plan: BOOK XXVII. TURKEY IN ASIA. PART II. Including Armenia Mesopotamia and Irac Arabi. The eastern provinces of the Turkish empire in Asia form three natural divisions: the region of Orontes and Libanus, or Syria and Palestine; that of the sources of the Euphrates and of the Tigris, or Armenia with Koordistan; finally, the region of Lower Euphrates, or Al-Djesira with Irac-Arabi, otherwise Mesopotamia, and Babylonia. We shall here connect the two divisions on the Euphrates, without confounding them. Syria will be described in a separate book. [...] Population. It would be vain to expect a near approximation to the truth in any conjectures which we might indulge respecting the population of a state in which registers and a regular census are unknown. Some writers estimate that of European Turkey at twenty-two, while others have reduced it to eight millions (Bruns. Magas. Géograph. I. cah. 1. p.\\xa068–74. compared with Ludeck\\'s Authentic Account of the Ottoman Empire. Etton\\'s View and de Tott\\'s Memoirs.), and both assign equally plausible grounds for their opinions. Respecting Asiatic Turkey, the uncertainty, if not still greater, is at least more generally acknowledged. Supposing the houses to be as thinly scattered as in the less populous parts of Spain, the population of all Turkey, in Europe, Asia, and Africa, may amount to 25 or 30 millions, of which one half belongs to Asia. Under the want of any thing like positive evidence, we shall not deviate far from probability in allowing to Anatolia, five millions; to Armenia, two; to Koordistan, one; to the pashâlics of Bagdat, Mosul, and Diarbekir, one and a half; and to Syria 1,800,000, or at most two millions.\\n 1822: James Silk Buckingham, Travels in Palestine, through the countries of Bashan and Gilead, east of the river Jordan: incl. a visit to the cities of Geraza and Gamala, in the Decapolis: St. Jerome conceived it [Ramla] to be the Arimathea of the Scriptures; and Adrichomius, who entertained a similar opinion, traces its various names through all their changes, from Ramathaim and Ramah, as it is called in the Old Testament, to Ramatha or Armatha the seat of Samuel, as Josephus has it, and to the Arimathea of the New Testament, and the Ramla of the present day. The oriental geographers speak of this as the metropolis of Palestine, and every appearance of its ruins even now confirm the opinion of its having been once a considerable city. Its situation, as lying immediately in the high road from Jaffa to Jerusalem, made it necessarily a place of great resort; and from the fruitfulness of the country around it, it must have been equally important as a military station or a depôt for supplies, and as a magazine for the collection of such articles of commerce as were exported from the coast.

[...] I never saw any of them with veils; and was informed that it is the general practice of the Jewesses in Jerusalem to go with their faces uncovered; they are the only females there who do so. Generally speaking, I think they are disposed to be rather of a plethoric habit; and the admirers of size and softness in the fair sex, will find as regularly well-built fatties, with double mouldings in the neck and chin, among the fair daughters of Jerusalem, as among the fairer daughters of England.\\n 1823: Charles Leonard Irby, James Mangles, Travels in Egypt and Nubia, Syria, and Asia Minor; During the Years 1817 and 1818: Our attention was the more attracted by this [Necropolis of Petra] monument, as it presents, perhaps, the only existing example of pyramids so applied, though we read of them as placed in a similar manner on the summit of the tomb of the Maccabees, and of the Queen of Adiabaene, both in the neighbouring province of Palestine.\\n 1823: Ernst Friedrich Karl Rosenmüller, \"Geographie von Palästina.\" Handbuch der biblischen Altertumskunde: Biblische Geographie 1824: Robert Watt, Syria, Bibliotheca Britannica; Or, A General Index to British and Foreign Literature: SYRIA (S.), a province of Turkey, in Asia. ——HISTORY.\\n--DESCRIPTIONS. —1677.

The dimensions of this country do not correspond to its fame: it may be 150 miles in length north and south, and nearly as much in extreme breadth. It is bounded on the west by the Mediterranean; on the north it ranges along the southern skirts of Libanus; while on the east and south it passes into the Arabian desert, amid long ranges of rocky hills. Judea is a high country, rising by successive terraces from a shore that is, in many places bold and lofty. Its principal eminences, Carmel, Bashan, Tabor, do not ascend into bleak and rugged heights: they are covered with villages, rich pastures, and luxuriant woods; on their slopes are copious vineyards, and in the clefts of the rocks numerous bees, feeding on their aromatic plants, deposit their honey. Traces are even found of a cultivation, by artificial terraces, equal to that which prevails in the most improved parts of the East.\\n 1838: Charles G. Addison, Damascus and Palmyra: a journey to the East: In the commencement of 1834, insurrections broke out in the mountains of Nablous, on Djebel Khalil, and in various parts of Palestine. Some of them, it is admitted, were promoted by the lawless and the disaffected to all settled government; others were fostered by the Sheikhs, who were discontented at their exactions from Christian pilgrims being put an end to, and many by the Bedouin Arabs and the mountaineers of Lebanon, who were discontented that the contributions they had been in the habit of imposing upon villages had been stopped.\\n 1840: Ferdinand de Géramb, A pilgrimage to Palestine, Egypt and Syria: And, once more, that which most contributes to render Palestine a desert is the despotic government under which it groans, and the motto of which is destruction. It cannot be too often repeated —the Porte daily puts up this wretched country to auction : the pacha who offers most becomes its tyrant. Master of the life of the Arab as well as of his camel, of his horse as well as of his tent, he marks his passage by exactions alone. At sight of his satellites coming to levy the tribute, the population of whole villages abandon their ruined dwellings; and the poor oppressed inhabitants choose rather to die of want, in caverns of the rocks, than to expire under the bastinado of the soldier, who on his part, enraged at seeing his prey escape, revenges himself by cutting down the olive-tree of the fugitive whom he could not overtake.\\n 1840: George Long, Palestine & Syria, The Penny Cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge: The modern history of Palestine is more conveniently included under SYRIA. The only portions of it which demand a separate notice have been treated of under Crusades. At present the country forms a part of Syria being included under the pashaliks of Damascus Akka and Tripoli and forming part of the viceroyalty of the pasha of Egypt. [...] In the most usual application of the word, Syria was the district bounded by the range of Amanus on the north, by the Mediterranean on the west, by the Euphrates and the Arabian Desert on the east and south, and by the \\'river of Egypt\\' probably the river (El-Arish) on the south-west. In a still narrower sense it sometimes denoted the same district, with the exception of Phoenicia and Palestine, (Ptol., v. 16.) Herodotus, in speaking of Palestine, includes it in Syria, as a subordinate division: he calls it \\'the Palestine Syria\\' (???, ii. 106).\\n 1840: John Kitto, The Pictorial History of Palestine and The Holy Land including a Complete History Of The Jews,Vol. I.

Santa Saba, 8 or 9 miles S.E. of Jerusalem, a monastery remarkable for its situation on a height, which rises precipitously several hundred feet from the deep valley of the brook Kedron. Beside it are numerous grottoes, which are said to have been inhabited by more than 10,000 monks at the epoch when St. Saba introduced the monastic life into Palestine. In continual danger from the wild Arabs, the convent appears like a fortress, with immensely strong and lofty towers.\\n 1843: Alexander Keith, The Land of Israel, According to the Covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob: Palestine abounding in cultivated and flourishing regions, has several great cities which rival each other in their excellence, viz. Caesarea, Eleutheropolis, Neapolis, Askelon, and Gaza. The region beyond the Jordan, donominated Arabia, is rich in the variety of the merchandise of which it is full; it has besides other large towns the cities of Bostra, Gerasa, and Philadelphia, which the solidity of their walls renders most secure (Ammianus Marcellinus, lib. xiv. cap. viii.). [...] In Palestine, sesamum abounds, from which they procure oil, and dourra (a kind of pulse) as good as that of Egypt. Maize thrives in the light soil of Baalbec; and even rice is cultivated with success on the borders of the marshy countries of Havula. They have lately begun to cultivate sugar-canes in the gardens of Saide and of Beyrout, equal to those of the Delta. Indigo grows without cultivation on the banks of the Jordan, in the country of Bisan, and needs but care to improve the quality. Tobacco is now cultivated throughout all the mountains. As for trees, the olive of Provence grows at Antioch, and at Ramla, to the height of the beech. In the white mulberry-tree consists the wealth of the whole country of the Druses, by the beautiful silk which it produces; while the vine, supported by poles, or winding about the oaks, supplies grapes, which afford red and white wines equal to those of Bourdeaux. The water-melons of Jaffa are preferred before the very fine water melons of Broulas. Gaza produces dates like Mecca, and pomegranates like Algiers. Tripoli affords oranges like Malta. Beyrout, figs like Marseilles, and bananas like St Domingo. Aleppo has the (not) exclusive advantage of producing pistachios. And Damascus justly boasts of possessing all the fruits known in the provinces: its stony soil suits equally the apples of Normandy, the plums of Touraine, and the peaches of Paris. Twenty sorts of apricots aro enumerated there, the stone of one of which contains a kernel highly valued throughout Turkey. The cochineal plant, which grows on all that coast contains, perhaps, that precious insect in as high perfection as it is found in Mexico and St Domingo; and if we consider that the mountains of Yemen, which produce such excellent coffee are only a continuation of those of Syria, and that their soil and climate are almost the same, we shall be induced to believe that in Judea particularly, might be easily cultivated this valuable production of Arabia. \"With these advantages of climate and soil, it is not surprising that Syria should always have been reckoned a most delicious country and that the Greeks and Romans esteemed it among the most beautiful of their provinces and equal even to Egypt\" (Volney\\'s Trav. vol. i. pp.\\xa0316–321. English translation).\\n 1843: Origen Bacheler, Restoration and Conversion of the Jews: But ever since 1832, when Mehemet Ali took possession of Syria, there has been a remarkable flocking of the Jews to Palestine. The precise number of them at present in the Holy Land is estimated to amount to about 40,000.\\n 1843: Stephen Olin, Travels in Egypt, Arabia Petræa, and the Holy land: European merchants could not live in the East, except under the protection of their own consuls. They never become subjects to the native rulers. If some civilized, Christian power would rescue Palestine, by treaty or force, from Mohammedan rule, and establish an enlightened, equitable, and stable government, then might it become a desirable residence for civilized men; but on no other condition could a residence there be endured by any but barbarians, content to be poor and tolerant from long habit of oppression and injustice. It fills me with surprise to see some of the best men of England labouring to promote the colonization of Jews in Palestine, and that under existing governments. The Jews are precisely the last people on earth fitted for such an enterprise, as they are a nation of traffickers, and know nothing of agriculture. Besides, the Jews of Europe and America are civilized and wealthy, and would not relish oppression and robbery, even in Palestine.\\n 1843: Johann Friedrich Röhr, Röhr\\'s Historico-geographical account of Palestine: Researches in Palestine: Napoleon Bonaparte, in 1799, gave new importance to Palestine. It was connected with his conquest of Egypt, and was undertaken nominally to repulse the Turkish army under Djezzar (Or the Butcher, so called by his subjects from his incredible cruelties. He died in 1808, apparently with a quiet conscience), the Pacha of St Jean d\\'Acre, by which he was threatened, and prevent it obstructing his intentions as to Egypt, but actually to get possession of the vast wealth of this Pacha, treasured up in Acre, and make this the foundation of other extensive projects as to the east.\\n 1844: J.

Some zealous writers, to give the land of the Hebrews some political importance, have exaggerated the extent of Palestine; but we have an authority for us that one can not reject. St. Jerome, who had long traveled in this country, said in his letter to Dardanus (ep. 129) that the northern boundary to that of the southern, was a distance of 160 Roman miles, which is about 55 .

The country around was luxuriant with vegetation, and the yellow grain, even as we looked, was falling beneath the sickle. Variegated flint, chalk and limestone, without fossils, cropped out occasionally on the hill sides; but along the lower slopes, and in the bottom of the valley, were continuous groves, with a verdant carpet beneath them. It was the most rural and the loveliest spot we had seen in Palestine.

His son, Abraim Pacha, moved suddenly with a large force towards Palestine, and took without almost any resistance on the part of the adherents of the Sultan, Jaffa, Jerusalem, Nablus, and Chaifa, and placed Egyptian soldiers as garrisons in the same, and appeared next before Akko, which was occupied by Abd Alla Pacha, and besieged it a long time, and took it finally by storm, carrying away the Pacha as prisoner to Egypt.

Notwithstanding all this, Mr. Gibbon remarks, speaking of Phoenicia and Palestine (Chap. i. p. 21), \"The former of these was a narrow and rocky coast; the latter was a territory scarcely superior to Wales either in fertility or extent. ...M. Guizot supposes he based his remark upon a passage in Strabo (Bk. xvi. 1104), who speaks only of the country around Jerusalem which he says was unfruitful and arid for sixty stadia (probably five or six miles;) in other places giving excellent testimony to the fertility of Palestine. He says, \"About Jericho is a forest of palm-trees, and the country for a hundred stadia is full of springs and well peopled.\"\\n 1860: Josias Leslie Porter, ed. Thomas Stewart Traill, Syria, Encyclopædia Britannica: The modern inhabitants of Syria and Palestine are a mixed race, made up of the descendants of the ancient Syrians who occupied the country in the early days of Christianity and of the Arabians who came in with the armies of the khalifs and settled in the cities and villages. The number of the latter being comparatively small, the mixture of blood did not visibly change the type of the ancient people. This may be seen by comparing the Christians with the Muslems. The former are undoubtedly of pure Syrian descent, while the latter are more or less mixed, and yet there is no visible distinction between the two save what dress makes.

The hermits and anchorets, as they were called, were held in high esteem, and thousands of pilgrims, from all parts, sought their cells to obtain the benefit of their prayers. In the fourth century, the ancient lands of Syria and Palestine were full of such \"holy men,\" and soon after they began to form societies and live together, as brethren, under oaths and regulations. This was the origin of religious houses or convents of monks; and the beginning of that monastic system which afterward extended throughout all Christendom.

This name has the authority of the prophet lsaiah, among the sacred writers: and was received by the earliest secular historians. Herodotus calls the Hebrews Syrians of Palestine; and states that the sea-border of Syria, inhabited, according to him by Phoenicians from the Red Sea, was called Palaestina as far as Egypt (vii. 89). He elsewhere places Syria Palaestina between Phoenice and Egypt; Tyre and Sidon in Phoenice: Ascalon, Cadytis Ienysus in Palaestina Syriae; elsewhere he places Cadytis and Azotus simply in Syria (iv. 39, iii. 5, ii. 116, 157, i. 105, iii. 5). [...] The most valuable contributions to the ancient geography of Palestine are those of Eusebius and his commentator S.

Colonel Symes explained that the country was described as \"Palestine\" by Europeans and as \"Falestin\" by the Arabs. The Hebrew name for the country was the designation \"Land of Israel,\" and the Government, to meet Jewish wishes, had agreed that the word \"Palestine\" in Hebrew characters should be followed in all official documents by the initials which stood for that designation.

It comprises a total of 1,796 islands scattered between Sumatra, Malay Peninsula, and Borneo including the Riau Archipelago. Situated on one of the world\\'s busiest shipping lanes along the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea (Natuna Sea), the province shares water borders with neighboring countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Brunei. The Riau Islands also has a relatively large potential of mineral resources, energy, as well as marine resources. The capital of the province is Tanjung Pinang and the largest city is Batam.\\n\\nThe Riau archipelago was once part of the Johor Sultanate, which was later partitioned between the Dutch East Indies and British Malaya after the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824, in which the archipelago fell under Dutch influence. A Dutch protectorate, the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, was established in the region between 1824 and 1911 before being directly ruled by the Dutch East Indies. The archipelago became a part of Indonesia following the occupation of the Japanese Empire (1942–1945) and the Indonesian National Revolution (1945–1949). The Riau Islands separated from the province of Riau in September 2002, becoming Indonesia\\'s third-youngest province.\\n\\nA free trade zone of the Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle, the Riau Islands has experienced rapid industrialisation since the 1970s. The Riau Islands is one of the country\\'s most prosperous provinces, having a GDP per capita of  () as of 2011, the fourth largest among all provinces in Indonesia after East Kalimantan, Jakarta and Riau. In addition, as of 2018, the Riau Islands has a Human Development Index of 0.748, also the fourth largest among all provinces in Indonesia after Jakarta, Special Region of Yogyakarta and East Kalimantan.\\n\\nThe population of the Riau Islands is heterogeneous and is highly diverse in ethnicity, culture, language and religion. The province is home to different ethnic groups such as the Malays, Tionghua, Javanese, Minangkabau and others. Economic rise in the region has attracted many immigrants and labors from other parts of Indonesia. The area around Batam is also home to many expatriates from different countries. Approximately 80% of these are from other Asian countries, with most of the westerners coming from the United Kingdom, rest of Europe, as well as Australia and the United States. The province also has the second largest number of foreign tourist arrivals in Indonesia, after Bali.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nEtymology \\nThere are several possible origins of the word riau. The first possible origins is that riau is derived from the Portuguese word rio, which means river. After the fall of the Malacca Sultanate in the early 16th century, the remaining Malaccan nobles and subjects fled from Malacca to mainland Sumatra while being pursued by the Portuguese. The Portuguese is believed to have reached as far as the Siak River.\\n\\nThe second version claims that riau comes from the word riahi which means sea water.  The word is allegedly derived from the figure of Sinbad al-Bahar in the book of the One Thousand and One Nights.\\n\\nAnother version is that riau is derived from the Malay word riuh, which means crowded, frenzied working people. This word is believed used to reflect the nature of the Malay people in present-day Bintan. The name is likely to have become famous since Raja Kecil moved the Malay kingdom center from Johor to Ulu Riau in 1719. This name was used as one of the four main sultanates that formed the kingdoms of Riau, Lingga, Johor and Pahang. However, as the consequences of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 between the Netherlands and United Kingdom, the Johor-Pahang sultanates fell under British influence, while the Riau-Lingga sultanates fell under Dutch influence.\\n\\nPre-sultanate era \\n\\nDue to its strategic location and size, the Riau Archipelago has a rich history. Riau has for centuries been the home of Malay and Orang Laut people (sea nomads). Later migrants came from southern China and Indochina, today people from a large region of Asia has settled here. The Riau archipelago was located aside the China-India maritime trading route, and was early in the 14th century, together with Temasek (Singapore), recorded in Chinese maritime records as one of Riau archipelago\\'s islands that was inhabited by Malay pirates.\\n\\nAs many as three hundred ships were used to force Chinese ships returning from the Indian Ocean into pirate harbors and to attack those who resisted. Large quantities of Chinese ceramics have been recovered on Bintan, some date back to the early Song dynasty (960–1127). An Arabian explorer, Ibnu Battuta, wrote about Riau in the 13th century: \"Here there are little islands, from which armed black pirates with poised arrows emerged, possessing armed warships; they plunder people but do not enslave them.\" Log records of Chinese ships testify these incidents in the 12th century. Even after several centuries, the Riau archipelago, especially Bintan, is still referred to as the \"Pirate Island\".\\n\\nDuring the 12th to 13th century, the Riau archipelago was a part of Srivijaya Empire on Sumatra. Sri Tri Buana, a member of the royal family of Palembang, visited Riau in 1290. The Queen of Bintan met him, and he combined flotilla of 800 vessels sailed for Bintan where he later became a king. It is also said that it was he who gave name to Singapore. Upon landing on Temasek, the old name of Singapore, he spotted an animal, which he thought was a lion, and renamed Temasek as Singapura (Lion City). He also proclaimed himself as a king of Singapore.\\n\\nAccording to the Malay Annals, a Srivijaya prince named Seri Teri Buana, fleeing from the sacking of Palembang, stayed on Bintan for several years, gathering his strength before founding the Kingdom of Singapura (Singapore).\\n\\nSultanate era \\n\\nDuring the rule of Sultan Mansur Shah (1459–1466), the Riau archipelago became the part of the Malacca Sultanate. The Malacca Sultanate then included Kedah, Trengganu, Pahang, Johore, Jambi, Kampar, Bengkalis, Karimun Islands and Bintan. The fall of Malacca Empire started in 1511 when Malacca fell to the Portuguese. Sultan Mahmud Shah fled to Pahang and then to Johor and Bintan in 1521. There, he held out against Portuguese attacks, he even laid siege on Malacca in 1524, before a Portuguese counterattack forced him to flee to Sumatra where he died in 1528. Sultan Alauddin succeeded his father and made a new capital in the south. His realm was the Johor Sultanate, the successor of Malacca. The archipelago became the part of \"war triangle\" between the Portuguese, the Johor Sultanate and the Achehnese of northern Sumatra.\\n\\nBintan may have seen many rulers during this time, as the three parties grew and declined in power. Subsequently, the Portuguese attacked Johor in 1587. The battle, known as the Siege of Johor, resulted in the Portuguese emerging victorious. The forces of Johor were incapable of preventing the heavy Portuguese infantry from landing and storming the city after a naval bombardment, and its Sultan was forced to retreat into the jungle in a rout. The Portuguese captured ample spoils, which included over 1000 cannon, the great majority of them of small caliber, 1500 firearms, and burned upwards to 2000 craft of many sizes. Following the attack, Dom Pedro de Lima (brother of Dom Paulo de Lima) also sacked Bintan, then a vassal of Johor.\\n\\nAfter the fall of Malacca in 1511, the Riau islands became the centre of political power of the mighty Sultanate of Johor or Johor-Riau, based on Bintan Island, and were for long considered the centre of Malay culture. Like Malacca before it, Riau was also the centre of Islamic studies and teaching. Many orthodox scholars from the Muslim heartlands like the Indian Subcontinent and Arabia were housed in special religious hostels, while devotees of Sufism could seek initiation into one of the many Tariqah (Sufi Brotherhood) which flourished in Riau. In many ways, Riau managed to recapture some of the old Malacca glory. Both became prosperous due to trade but there was a major difference; Malacca was also great due to its territorial conquest. On the northern part of Sumatra around the same period, the Aceh Sultanate was beginning to gain substantial influence over the Straits of Malacca. With the fall of Malacca to Christian hands, Muslim traders often skipped Malacca in favour of Aceh or also of Johor\\'s capital Johor Lama (Kota Batu). Therefore, Malacca and Aceh became direct competitors. With the Portuguese and Johor frequently locking horns, Aceh launched multiple raids against both sides to tighten its grip over the straits. The rise and expansion of Aceh encouraged the Portuguese and Johor to sign a truce and divert their attention to Aceh. The truce, however, was short-lived and with Aceh severely weakened, Johor and the Portuguese had each other in their sights again. During the rule of Sultan Iskandar Muda, Aceh attacked Johor in 1613 and again in 1615.\\n\\nWith the fall of Portuguese Malacca in 1641 and the decline of Aceh due to the growing power of the Dutch, Johor started to re-established itself as a power along the Straits of Malacca during the reign of Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah III (1623–1677). Its influence extended to Pahang, Sungei Ujong, Malacca, Klang and the Riau Archipelago.\\n\\nIn the early 18th century, the descendants of the Sultan and the Regent of Johor where fighting for power. Bugis aristocrats from Celebes was asked to assist the Regent of Johor, and managed to achieve control of Riau due to the internal struggle between the members of the Johor Sultanate. The Bugis were great traders and made Bintan as a major trading center. Riau and Bintan also attracted British, Chinese, Dutch, Arabic and Indian traders.  The Dutch however started to look upon Riau and the Bugis as a dangerous rival to Dutch trade in the region, drawing away trade from their ports in Malacca and Batavia (Jakarta). A Dutch fleet attacked Riau in 1784 but failed to hold the islands. Another attempt later the same year also failed before they managed to break the Bugis blockade of Malacca in June 1784. The Bugis commander, Raja Haji was killed during battle and the Bugis units retreated, which opened the way for a Dutch counterattack on Riau. The Bugis was expelled from Bintan and Riau, and a treaty between the Dutch and the Malay sultans granted Dutch control over the area. The treaty caused much anger among Malay rulers, and again in 1787 a force that was offered refuge by Sultan Mahmud drove out the Dutch. This also led to the return of the Bugis and the rivalry between Bugis and Malay. Peace between the two parties was finally reached in 1803. Around this time Sultan Mahmud gave Penyengat Island as a wedding gift to his bride, Raja Hamidah, Raja Ali Haji\\'s daughter. Penyengat became for a period the center of government, Islamic religion and the Malay culture.\\n\\nColonial rule \\n\\nIn 1812, the Johor-Riau Sultanate experienced a succession crisis. The death of the Mahmud Shah III in Lingga left no heir apparent. Royal custom required that the succeeding sultan must be present at his predecessor\\'s deathbed. However at the time Mahmud Shah III died, the eldest prince, Tengku Hussein, was in Pahang to celebrate his marriage to the daughter of the Bendahara (governor). The other candidate was Tengku Hussein\\'s half-brother, Tengku Abdul Rahman. To complicate matters, neither of the candidates was of full royal blood. The mother of Tengku Hussein, Cik Mariam, owed her origin to a Balinese slave lady and a Bugis commoner. Tengku Abdul Rahman had a similarly lowborn mother, Cik Halimah. The only unquestionably royal wife and consort of Mahmud Shah was Engku Puteri Hamidah, whose only child had died an hour after birth. In the following chaos, Engku Puteri was expected to install Tengku Hussein as the next sultan, because he had been preferred by the late Mahmud Shah. Based on the royal adat (customary observance), the consent of Engku Puteri was crucial as she was the holder of the Cogan (Royal Regalia) of Johor-Riau, and the installation of a new sultan was only valid if it took place with the regalia. The regalia was fundamental to the installation of the sultan; it was a symbol of power, legitimacy and the sovereignty of the state. Nonetheless, Yang Dipertuan Muda Jaafar (then-viceroy of the sultanate) supported the reluctant Tengku Abdul Rahman, adhering to the rules of royal protocol, as he had been present at the late Sultan\\'s deathbed.\\n\\nRivalry between the British and the Dutch now came into play. The British had earlier gained Malacca from the Dutch under the Treaty of The Hague in 1795 and saw an opportunity to increase their regional influence. They crowned Tengku Hussein in Singapore, and he took the title Hussein Shah of Johor. The British were actively involved in the Johor-Riau administration between 1812 and 1818, and their intervention further strengthened their dominance in the Strait of Malacca. The British recognised Johor-Riau as a sovereign state and offered to pay Engku Puteri 50,000 Ringgits (Spanish Coins) for the royal regalia, which she refused. Seeing the diplomatic advantage gained in the region by the British, the Dutch responded by crowning Tengku Abdul Rahman as sultan instead. They also obtained, at the Congress of Vienna, a withdrawal of British recognition of Johor-Riau sovereignty. To further curtail the British domination over the region, the Dutch entered into an agreement with the Johor-Riau Sultanate on 27 November 1818. The agreement stipulated that the Dutch were to be the paramount leaders of the Johor-Riau Sultanate and that only Dutch people could engage in trade with the kingdom. A Dutch garrison was then stationed in Riau. The Dutch also secured an agreement that Dutch consent was required for all future appointments of Johor-Riau Sultans. This agreement was signed by Yang Dipertuan Muda Raja Jaafar representing Abdul Rahman, without the sultan\\'s consent or knowledge.\\n\\nJust as the British had done, both the Dutch and Yang Dipertuan Muda then desperately tried to win the royal regalia from Engku Puteri. The reluctant Abdul Rahman, believing he was not the rightful heir, decided to move from Lingga to Terengganu, claiming that he wanted to celebrate his marriage. The Dutch, who desired to control the Johor-Riau Empire, feared losing momentum because of the absence of mere regalia. They therefore ordered Timmerman Tyssen, the Dutch Governor of Malacca, to seize Penyengat in October 1822 and remove the royal regalia from Tengku Hamidah by force. The regalia was then stored in the crown prince\\'s fort in Tanjung Pinang. Engku Puteri was reported to have written a letter to Van Der Capellen, the Dutch Governor in Batavia, about this issue. With the royal regalia in Dutch hands, Abdul Rahman was invited from Terengganu and proclaimed as the Sultan of Johor, Riau-Lingga and Pahang on 27 November 1822. Hence, the legitimate ruler of the Johor-Riau Empire was now Abdul Rahman, rather than the British-backed Hussein.\\n\\nThis led to the partition of Johor-Riau under the Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1824, by which the region north of the Singapore Strait including the island of Singapore and Johor were to be under British influence, while the south of the strait along with Riau and Lingga were to be controlled by the Dutch. By installing two sultans from the same kingdom, both the British and the Dutch effectively destroyed the Johor-Riau polity and satisfied their colonial ambitions. Under the treaty, Tengku Abdul Rahman was crowned as the Sultan of Riau-Lingga, bearing the name of Sultan Abdul Rahman, with the royal seat in Daik, Lingga. Tengku Hussein, backed by the British, was installed as the Sultan of Johore and ruled over Singapore and the Peninsular Johor. He later ceded Singapore to the British in return for their support during the dispute. Both sultans of Johor and Riau acted mainly as Puppet monarchs under the guidance of the colonial powers.\\n\\nThe globalization of the 19th century opened new opportunities for the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. Proximity to cosmopolitan Singapore, just 40 miles away, shaped the political climate of the kingdom, giving Riau Malays an opportunity to familiarize themselves with new ideas from the Middle East. The opening of Suez Canal meant a journey to Mecca via Port Said, Egypt and Singapore could take no more than a fortnight; thus these cities became major ports for the Hajj pilgrimage. Inspired by the experience and intellectual progress attained in the Middle East and influenced by the Pan-Islamism brotherhood, the Riau Malay intelligentsia established the Roesidijah (Club) Riouw in 1895. The association was born as a literary circle to develop the religious, cultural and intellectual needs of the sultanate, but as it matured, it changed into a more critical organisation and began to address the fight against Dutch rule in the kingdom. The late 19th century was marked by growing awareness among the elite and rulers of the importance of watan (homeland) and one\\'s duty towards his or her native soil. To succeed to establish a watan, the land must be independent and sovereign, a far-cry from a Dutch-controlled sultanate. Moreover, it was also viewed that the penetration of the west in the state was slowly tearing apart the fabric of the Malay-Muslim identity.\\n\\nBy the dawn of the 20th century, the association had become a political tool for rising against the colonial power, with Raja Muhammad Thahir and Raja Ali Kelana acting as its backbone. Diplomatic missions were sent to the Ottoman Empire in 1883, 1895 and in 1905 to secure the liberation of the kingdom by Raja Ali Kelana, accompanied by a renowned Pattani-born Ulema, Syeikh Wan Ahmad Fatani. The Dutch Colonial Office in Tanjung Pinang labelled the organisation as a left-leaning party. The organisation also won momentous support from the Mohakamah (Malay Judiciary) and the Dewan Kerajaan (Sultanate Administrative Board). It critically monitored and researched every step taken by the Dutch Colonial Resident in the sultanate\\'s administration, which outraged the Dutch.\\n\\nThe movement was an early form of Malay nationalism. Non-violence and passive resistance measures were adopted by the association. The main method of the movement was to hold symbolic boycotts. The Dutch then branded the movement as a passive resistance (Dutch: leidelek verset), and passive acts such as ignoring the raising of the Dutch flag were met with anger by the Batavia-based Raad van Indie (Dutch East Indies Council) and the Advisor on Native Affairs, Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje. Hurgronje wrote a secret letter to the Raad van Indie, advocating that the sultanate and association be crushed as resistance in the earlier Aceh War had been. Hurgronje justified this with several arguments, among which were that since 1902 the members of the Roesidijah Klub would gather around the royal court and refuse to raise the Dutch flag on government vessels. The Dutch Colonial Resident in Riau, A.L. Van Hasselt advised the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies that the Sultan was an opponent to the Dutch and immersed with a group of hardcore resistant. Later, on 1 January 1903, the Dutch Colonial Resident found that the Dutch flag was not being raised during his visit to the royal palace. In his report to the governor he wrote; \"it seems that he (Sultan Abdul Rahman II) acted as if he was a sovereign king and he raises his own flag\". Based on several records in the Indonesian National Archive, there were some reports that the Sultan then apologized to the governor over the \"flag incident\".\\n\\nOn 18 May 1905, the Dutch demanded a new agreement with the sultan, stipulating further limits on the powers of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, requiring that the Dutch flag must be raised higher than the flag of Riau, and specifying that Dutch officials should be given supreme honor in the land. The agreement further stipulated that the Riau-Lingga Sultanate was a mere loan from the Dutch Government. The agreement was drawn up due to the fact that the appointment of Sultan Abdul Rahman II had not been made with the consent of the Dutch and he was also clearly against colonial rule.\\n\\nThe Dutch insisted that the sultan sign the agreement, but after consulting the fellow rulers of the state, Engku Kelana, Raja Ali, Raja Hitam and other members of the ruling elite, he refused, and decided to form a military regiment under the leadership of the prince regent, Tengku Umar. During a visit of the Dutch Resident\\'s visit to Penyengat, the sultan then, on his own authority and without Dutch approval, summoned the rulers of Reteh, Gaung and Mandah, making the Resident feel as if he was being intimidated by the sultanate. The affiliates of the Roesidijah Klub, mainly the members of the administrative class, were thus able to slowly maneuver Abdul Rahman, once a supporter of Dutch rule, to act against the colonial power\\'s wishes.\\n\\nOn the morning of 11 February 1911, when the sultan and the court officials were in Daik to perform the Mandi Safar (a ritual purifying bath), ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy anchored in Penyengat Island and deployed hundreds of native soldiers (Dutch: marechausse) to lay siege to the royal court. This was followed by the arrival of Dutch official K.M Voematra from Tanjung Pinang at the Roesidijah Club headquarters to announce the deposition of Abdul Rahman II. The Dutch then seized the official coronation regalia, and to prevent their seizure by the Dutch, many official buildings were deliberately razed by members of the court themselves. A mass exodus of civilians and officials to Johor and Singapore then took place. To avoid violence and the death of civilians in Pulau Penyengat, the sultan and his officials decided not to fight the Dutch troops. The sultan and  Tengku Ampuan (the Queen) left Pulau Penyengat and sailed to Singapore in the royal vessel Sri Daik, while Crown Prince Raja Ali Kelana, Khalid Hitam and the resistance movement in Bukit Bahjah followed a couple of days later. The deposed Abdul Rahman II was forced to live in exile in Singapore, where he died there in 1930 and was buried in Keramat Bukit Kasita, Kampung Bahru Road.\\n\\nThe Dutch officially annexed the sultanate to avoid future claims from the monarchy. Dutch direct rule over the Riau Archipelago began in 1913, and the province was administered as part of the Residency of Riau and Dependencies (Dutch: Residentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden). The Dutch Residency consisted of Tanjung Pinang, Lingga, the Riau mainland and Indragiri, while the Tudjuh Archipelago was administered separately as part of the Pulau-Tujuh Division (Dutch: Afdeeling Poelau-Toedjoeh).\\n\\nJapanese occupation and Independence \\n\\nWhen World War II broke out, the Dutch initially seemed reluctant to defend their territories in the East Indies. This led the British to consider creating a buffer state in Riau. They discussed prospects for a restoration with Tengku Omar and Tengku Besar, descendants of the sultans, who were then based in Terengganu. However, as the war approached Southeast Asia, the Dutch actively engaged in the defensive system alongside the British, and the British decided to shelve the restoration plan.\\n\\nIn the aftermath of the war and the struggle against Dutch rule, several exile associations collectively known as the Gerakan Kesultanan Riau (Riau Sultanate Movement) emerged in Singapore, planning for a restoration. Some of the groups dated from as early as the dissolution of the sultanate, but started to gain momentum following the post-world war confusion and politics. From the ashes of political uncertainty and fragility in the East Indies following the World War II, a royalist faction known as the Association of the Indigenous Riau Malays (Malay: Persatoean Melayu Riouw Sedjati) (PMRS) emerged to call for the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. The council was financially backed by rich Riau Malay émigrés and Chinese merchants who hoped to obtain tin concession. Initially founded in High Street, Singapore, the association moved to Tanjung Pinang, Riau with the unprecedented approval by the Dutch administrators. Based in Tanjung Pinang, the group managed to gain the consent of the Dutch for self-governance in the region with the foundation of the Riouw Council (Dutch: Riouw Raad, Malay: Dewan Riouw). The Riouw Council was the devolved national unicameral legislature of Riau, a position equivalent to a Parliament.\\n\\nAfter establishing itself in Tanjung Pinang, the group formed a new organisation known as Djawatan Koewasa Pengoeroes Rakjat Riow (The Council of Riau People Administration), with the members hailing from Tudjuh Archipelago, Great Karimun, Lingga and Singkep. This group strongly advocated the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate after the status of Indonesia became official. The leader of the council, Raja Abdullah, claimed that Riau Malays were neglected at the expense of the non-Riau Indonesians who dominated the upper ranks of the Riau civil administration. By restoring the monarch, they believed the position of Riau Malays would be guarded. The royalist association met with resistance from the republican group led by Dr. Iljas Datuk Batuah that sent delegates to Singapore to counter the propaganda of sultanate supporters. Based on Indonesian archive records, Dr. Iljas gained approvals from non-Malay newcomers to Riau, including Minang, Javanese, Palembang, and Batak people. He later formed a group known as the Badan Kedaulatan Indonesia Riouw (BKRI) (Indonesian Riau Sovereign Body) on 8 October 1945. The organisation sought to absorb the Riau Archipelago into the then-newly independent Indonesia, as the archipelago was still retained by the Dutch. BKRI hoped that the new administration under Sukarno would give the pribumis a fair chance to run the local government.\\n\\nThe royalist association would not give any public support to the Indonesian movement, as is evident in its refusal to display the Bendera Merah-Putih (Indonesian Flag) during the Indonesian Independence Day celebration on 17 August 1947 in Singapore. This led republicans to call the royalists \\'pro-Dutch\\'. The royalists however, maintained that Riau was a Dutch territory and that only the Dutch could support it. The Dutch countered the claims of the BKRI by granting autonomous rule to the Riau Council, in which links with the Dutch would be maintained while a restored sultanate would play a secondary role. The council, created following the decree of the Governor General of the East Indies on 12 July 1947, was inaugurated on 4 August 1947, and represented a major step forward in the revival of the monarchy system. Several key members of the PMRS were elected to the Riau Council alongside their BKRI rivals, the  from Tanjung Pinang and Pulau Tujuh, local Malay leaders of Lingga and Dutch Officials in Tanjung Pinang. On 23 January 1948, the states of the Bangka Council, the Belitung Council, and the Riau Council merged to form the Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation.\\n\\nThe call for revival of the sultanate continued throughout the period of autonomous rule under the Riau Council, although the influence of republicanism also continued to strengthen. The appeal of revival began to subside following the dissolution of the Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation on 4 April 1950. After the official withdrawal by the Dutch in 1950, the Riau Archipelago became Keresidenan Riau under Central Sumatra Province following the absorption by the United States of Indonesia. Being one of the last territories merged into Indonesia, Riau was known as the daerah-daerah pulihan (recovered regions), and the Riau area became a province in August 1957.\\n\\nThe leader of Riau forces, Major Raja Muhammad Yunus, who led the bid to reestablish the sultanate apart from Indonesia fled into exile in Johor after his ill attempt. The Geopolitical roots of the Riau Archipelago had molded her nationalist position to be sandwiched between the kindred monarchist Peninsular Malay Nationalism observed across the border in British Malaya with the pro-republic and pan-ethnic Indonesian Nationalism manifested in her own Dutch East Indies domain.\\n\\nContemporary era \\n\\nAfter the war, from 1950 the Riau archipelago was a duty-free zone till the Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation in 1963. During this period, the Malaya and British Borneo dollar used in British Malaya was the principal currency in the region. Visa free movement of people, which existed then is now no more prevalent. To affirm its fiscal stake in the region, a decree was passed on 15 October 1963 to replace the Malaya and British Borneo dollar (the circulating currency) with an Indonesian-issued currency, the Riau rupiah, which replaced the dollar at par. Although the rupiah resembled the Indonesian rupiah in appearance, it had a much higher value. Malayan money was withdrawn from 1 November 1963. The Riau rupiah was exchangeable as a foreign currency with the Indonesian rupiah. Since 1 July 1964, the Riau rupiah was no longer a valid currency, being replaced by the Indonesian rupiah at a rate of 1 Riau rupiah = 14.7 Indonesian rupiah.\\n\\nDue to its proximity to Singapore and Peninsular Malaysia, the Riau Islands area became the focus point during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. During this period, the territorial waters of the Riau Islands began to be visited by many Indonesian military forces who were members of the Indonesian Operations Command Corps or better known as the Indonesian Marine Corps. The city of Batam became one of the staging point of Indonesian troops during the confrontation, with the construction of military bases around the city. Anti-Malaysian guerrillas were gathered at Tanjung Balai Karimun to be trained and then sent to Sambu Island for briefing before operation. These guerrillas aimed to sabotage and spread information to help Indonesia fight the British in Malaysia, causing the economy around the Riau Islands, especially Tanjung Balai Karimun, does not function normally due to these military activities. At that time, KOPASKA special forces of the Indonesian Navy infiltrated Singapore from military bases in the Riau Islands, around Batam, Tanjung Balai Asahan and the surrounding area. They usually use small boats with outboard motors and disguise themselves as local residents who usually have relatives on the Malay Peninsula and Singapore. The coastline of Batam and the surrounding islands were heavily fortified to deter possible British and Malaysian invasion.\\n\\nThe end of the Indonesia-Singapore trade during the confrontation had made the economic conditions of the Riau Islands and Singaporeans disturbed. The inhabitants of Riau Islands can no longer barter or sell their produce to Singapore so that they cannot get basic necessities such as rice. Usually the basic needs of the Riau Islands population are brought in more from Singapore than anywhere else in Indonesia. Even vice versa, the supply of some needs of Singapore residents who are usually imported from the Riau Islands has been disrupted. Hostilities ceased in 1966 after the 30 September Movement attempted a coup d\\'état, resulting in the overthrow of the Sukarno regime which leads to a peace agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia that was signed on 28 May 1966 at Bangkok, Thailand.\\n\\nWith the initial aim of making Batam an Indonesian version of Singapore, according to Presidential Decree number 41 of 1973, Batam Island was designated as an industrial working area. This was supported by the Batam Island Industrial Area Development Authority, better known as the Batam Authority Agency (BOB) which is now the Batam Development Board (Indonesian: Badan Pengusahan Batam or BP Batam). In the 1980s, based on Government Regulation No. 34 of 1983, the Batam District was upgraded to the Batam Municipality. This body runs the government and community administration and supports the development carried out by the Batam Authority (BP Batam).\\n\\nSome level of unity returned in the Riau region for the first time after 150 years, with the creation of the Sijori Growth Triangle in 1989. But while bringing back some economical wealth to Riau, the Sijori Growth Triangle somewhat further broke the cultural unity within the islands. With Batam island receiving most of the industrial investments and dramatically developing into a regional industrial centre, it attracted hundreds of thousands of non-Malay Indonesian migrants, changing forever the demographic balance in the archipelago. A number of studies and books have detailed the growing violence and concern about identity and social change in the archipelago. As the Malay, who were once the dominant ethnic group in the islands, have been reduced to about a third of the population, primarily as a result of immigration from elsewhere in Indonesia, they feel that their traditional rights are threatened. Similarly, the immigrants have felt politically and financially suppressed. Both of these causes have led to increased violence. Piracy in the archipelago is also an issue. There have been various attempts at both independence and autonomy for this part of Indonesia since the founding of Indonesia in 1945.\\n\\nPolitics\\n\\nGovernment \\n\\nThe province of Riau Island is led by a governor (gubernur) who is elected directly by the people. The Governor also acts as a representative or extension of the central government in the province, whose authority is regulated in Law No. 32 of 2004 and Government Regulation number 19 of 2010. The legislative branch of the Riau Island government is the Riau Islands Regional People\\'s Representatives Assembly (Indonesian: Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Kepulauan Riau – DPRD Kepri), which is considered as a unicameral legislative body. Both governors and the members of the assembly are elected by citizens every five years by universal suffrage. Prior to this, the local executives had been elected by a vote of the assembly. The governor office and the province assembly are located in Basuki Rahmat Road at Pulau Dompak, Tanjung Pinang.\\n\\nThe number of members of the assembly is at least thirty-five people and at most one hundred people with a term of office of five years and ends when the new assembly member takes an oath. Assembly membership was formalized by a decision of the Ministry of Home Affairs. As of 2019, there are 45 seats in the assembly, scattered in several political parties. The majority (8 seats) are currently held by Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDIP) after the 2019 general election.\\n\\nPrior to Dutch colonization, most of the modern-day province of Riau Islands is part of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. The sultanate was headed by a Sultan.The Sultan, who was a Malay, acted as Head of State while the Dipertuan Muda/Yamtuan Muda (deputy ruler or Viceroy), a position held by the Bugis ruling elite, served as the Head of Government.  The sultan\\'s royal palace was located in Penyengat Inderasakti, while the Yang Dipertuan Muda resided in Daik, Lingga. After becoming a Dutch protectorate, a Dutch resident was installed as an adviser to the sultan. For the hereditary position of the Sultan, the sultan was fully subjected under the influence of the Dutch East Indies authority. Albeit he is de jure on the apex of the monarchy system, he is under the direct control of the Dutch Resident in Tanjung Pinang. All matters pertaining the administration of the sultanate including the appointment of the Sultan and the Yang Dipertuan Muda, must be made within the knowledge and even the consent of the Dutch Resident.\\n\\nAfter the Dutch fully annexed the sultanate, a Dutch resident was posted in Tanjung Pinang, heading the Residency of Riau and Dependencies. During the 3 years of Japanese occupation, Japanese military officers and local Indonesian nationalist leaders headed the region.\\n\\nAdministrative Divisions \\n\\nThis province is divided into five regencies (kabupaten) and two autonomous cities (kota). These are subdivided into 70 districts (kecamatan) and then into 256 villages (desa or kelurahan). Each regency is headed by a regent (bupati), while each district is headed by a district chief (camat) and each village headed by a village chief (known as a kepala desa or penghulu) for each village in the district.\\n\\nDuring the Dutch East Indies era, the Riau Islands was included in the Residency of Riau and Dependencies (Dutch: Residentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden), which is also based in Tanjung Pinang. The Dutch Residency consisted of Tanjung Pinang, Lingga, the Riau mainland and Indragiri, while the Tudjuh Archipelago was administered separately as part of the Pulau-Tujuh Division (Dutch: Afdeeling Poelau-Toedjoeh).\\n\\nThe population of the regencies and cities of Riau Islands Province according to the 2010 and 2020 census results.\\n\\nSource: Badan Pusat Statistik, Republik Indonesia (web).\\n\\nEnvironment\\n\\nGeography and Climate \\n\\nThe total area of the Riau Islands is  (3,166.70 sq miles), making it the 31st largest province in Indonesia, slightly smaller than the province of Banten in Java. 96% of the total area of the province is encompasses of ocean and only 4% of it is encompasses of land . The province shares maritime border with Vietnam and Cambodia to the north, the province of Bangka Belitung Islands and Jambi in the south, East Malaysia, Brunei and the province of West Kalimantan in the east and Peninsular Malaysia, Singapore and mainland Riau in the west.\\n\\nThe island of Batam, which lies within the central core group of islands (the Riau Archipelago), contains a majority of the province\\'s population. Since becoming part of an economic zone with Singapore in 2006, it has experienced high population growth rates. Other highly populated islands in the Riau Archipelago include Bintan and Karimun, while the archipelago also includes islands such as Bulan and Kundur. There are around 3,200 islands in the province, which has its capital at Tanjung Pinang in the south of Bintan Island. The Riau Islands province includes the Lingga Islands to the south of the main Riau Archipelago, while to the northeast lies the Tudjuh Archipelago, between Borneo and mainland Malaysia; the Tudjuh Archipelago consists of four distinct groups – the Anambas Islands, Natuna Islands, Tambelan islands and Badas Islands — which were attached to the new province, though not geographically part of the Riau Archipelago. The 2020 census count was 2,064,564, making it one of the fastest growing province in Indonesia.\\n\\nThe highest point in Riau Islands is Mount Daik with a height of 1,165 meters (3,822\\xa0ft), which is located on Lingga Island. Most of the area on Lingga Island is hilly. The Lingga area is generally in the form of an area with a fairly high slope, where there are as many as 76.92 percent of the area which has a slope of more than 15%, while the plain area (slope less than 2%) only encompasses of 3.49 ha or 3.14 percent of the total area.\\n\\nWith strategic geographical location (between South China Sea, Malacca Strait and Karimata Strait) and supported by an abundance of natural potential, Riau Islands could possibly become one of the economic growth centers for Indonesia in the future, especially now that in some areas of the Riau Islands (Batam, Bintan and Karimun), a pilot project for the development of a Special economic zone is being pursued through cooperation with the Singaporean government. The implementation of the SEZ policy in Batam-Bintan-Karimun, is a close cooperation between the central government and local government, and the participation of the business world. This KEK/SER will be the nodes of the leading economic activity centers, supported by excellent service facilities and internationally competitive infrastructure capacity. Every business actor located within it will receive services and facilities of the highest quality that can compete with best practices from similar areas in Asia-Pacific.\\n\\nAs an archipelago, the climatic conditions in the province are affected by wind. Most of the province has wet tropical climate, there is rainy season and dry season interspersed with transition season with the lowest average temperature 20.4\\xa0°C. In November to February monsoon winds comes from the north and between June to December the monsoon winds comes from the south. During the northern monsoon the wind velocity at sea could range from 20 to 30 knots, on land the wind can range from 3–15 knots. This causes potentially extreme weather in the Riau Islands with rainfall of about 150–200 millimeters and wave height between 1.2 meters up to 3 meters.\\nAs in most other province of Indonesia, the Riau Islands has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification Af) bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall. According to Köppen and Geiger, this climate is classified as Af. In the Riau Islands, the average annual temperature is 25.2\\xa0°C. Precipitation here averages 2607\\xa0mm.\\n\\nOceanographic conditions, mainly wave and sea water current, in the study sites were influenced by wet monsoon period, i.e. from November to April. During the wet monsoon (wet season) the wind is characterized very strong, which blows from North-west to South-east or from South-west to North-east, with velocity ranges 7–20 knot (≈ 13–37\\xa0km/hour). The strongest wind usually occurs in around December–February, with velocity is about 45\\xa0km/hour. During this season the sea wave may very high, sometime > 2 m especially during December–February. While the east monsoon (dry season), it usually occur in period of May to October, with wind velocity is relatively calm, that is about 7- 15 knot (≈ 13–28\\xa0km/hour). The sea wave was not very high reaching only around 0.8 m. The sea water current in Riau islands follows the current pattern in Malacca strait. It is depends on the different between seawater level in northern part of Andaman Sea and southern part of Malacca Strait. Since seawater level in Pacific Ocean is always higher than in Indian Oceans, the seawater level in South China Sea is also higher than in Andaman Sea throughout the year resulted in Malacca Strait there is a current, which flow to Northwest direction throughout the year. In November to April, during the Northeast monsoon, Andaman Sea\\'s current goes to the north. Therefore, majority of water masses are transported to the north. Consequent of this, during these months, Andaman Sea\\'s water masses will be empty, and sea water level will be low or the different from South China Sea\\'s sea water level will be higher. This sea water level reaches to maximum in February to March, while the different of sea water level between Northern and southern parts of Strait is about 50\\xa0cm, which resulted current velocity is about 12\\xa0cm/sec to Northwest.\\n\\nConversely, during the southwest monsoon, May to October, most of the currents in western part of Andaman Sea go to east and south, therefore water masses will be gathering in Andaman Sea. This resulted in that sea water level increases in northern part of Malacca Strait, and the different of sea water level to South China Sea’s water level will be small, although in southern part of the Strait the sea water level is still higher. During this season, the water current in Malacca Strait flows to the north, with speed is little bit lower. Current velocity reaches to maximum in around July to August, with speed about 5\\xa0cm/sec. Oceanographic pattern is likely to affect the water quality and reef corals in the study sites. Strong wind during the wet monsoon period, for example, could cause water turbulence which affecting on high sediment, especially in coastal areas, and this might be worse with the high sediment run off from surrounding rivers and/or reclamation areas, such as happened in Batam. Water turbidity was recorded about 22 NTU during the wet season, and it is lower (about 7.4 NTU) in the dry season.\\n\\nBiodiversity \\n\\nRiau Islands became one of the coral reef conservation sites in Indonesia. Examples of coral reef conservation sites in the Riau Islands are Karang Alangkalam and Karang Bali. The area\\'s marine life has made the Natuna Sea into a scuba diving destination. While there were once threats towards the coral reefs in the region, such as blast fishing, a survey by the Indonesian Institute of Sciences found that most of the coral reef ecosystems and mangrove forests in a number of locations in the waters around Batam are in a good condition. Nevertheless, there are some threats that might endanger the ecosystem in the province, such as plastic waste which is mostly produced by households that are thrown into the sea. Illegal fishing is also one of the factor that damages the ecosystem in the region. The sea around the Natuna Islands in the previous years has been home to illegal fishing due to weak law enforcement in the region. Under the Widodo administration, the Natuna Sea has been frequently patrolled by the Indonesian Navy and the Indonesian Maritime Security Agency to prevent illegal fishing. This has resulted in the arrest of hundreds of fishing boats and their crews from countries such as Malaysia, Vietnam and China.\\n\\nAs most of the Riau Islands consists of islands, many beaches can be found in the province, such as Lagoi Beach, Impian Beach, Trikora Beach, Nongsa Beach, Sakerah Beach, Loola Beach, Padang Melang Beach, Nusantara Beach, Batu Leafy Beach, Indah Beach, Tanjung Siambang Beach, Tanjung Beach, Melur Beach, Melayu Beach, Pelawan Beach, Sisi Beach and Cemaga Beach.\\n\\nThe wealth of flora and fauna in the Riau Islands is also very diverse. The Lutjanus gibbus and Piper betle are the fauna and flora symbol of the Riau Islands province respectively. The Humphead wrasse (Cheilinus undulatus), which is an endangered type of fish, inhabits the Natuna Sea in the northern part of the province. In addition, Dugongs also live in the waters around the island of Bintan. Some other rare animals are the Tarsius, and the Natuna Island surili (Presbytis natunae), native to the island of Natuna. The Natuna Island surili is one of the 25 most endangered primates on Earth. Wealth of flora in the province includes the Oncosperma tigillarium, dragon fruit, areca nut and the rare udumbara plants that live on the Engku Puteri Plateau, Batam Center. The Riau Islands has 2 nature reserves, namely Pulau Burung Nature Reserve and Pulau Laut Nature Reserve.\\n\\nEconomy \\n\\nThe geographical position of the Riau Islands, which is close to neighboring countries located near the Strait of Malacca, which is one of the busiest shipping lane in the world, is also a major factor in the need to increase competitiveness. The geographical location can be a leverage in attracting foreign and domestic investors. However, the strategic geographical location will not provide benefits if the Riau Islands do not have competitiveness. This is because skilled workers and investors are more interested in areas that have competitiveness than regions that are not competitive. Therefore, increasing competitiveness is a necessity to attract investors, both foreign and domestic, to invest in the economic development of the Riau Islands.\\n\\nThe economic growth rate of Riau Islands Province in 2005 was 6.57%. Sectors that grew well (faster than the total GRDP growth) in 2005 included the transportation and communication sector (8.51%), the manufacturing sector (7.41%), the financial sector, leasing, and corporate services (6.89%), the service sector (6.77%), and the trade, hotel and restaurant sector (6.69%). GRDP Per capita of the Riau Islands in the last five years (2001–2005) tends to increase. In 2001 the GRDP per capita (above the prevailing price – without oil and gas) was Rp. 22,808 million, and in 2005 it increased to Rp.29,348\\xa0million. But in real terms (without calculating inflation) the Per capita GRDP (without gas) in 2001 was only Rp.20,397\\xa0million, and in 2005 it increased to Rp. 22,418\\xa0million.\\n\\nThe potential of natural wealth in the Riau Islands comes from mining and the manufacturing industries. The manufacturing sector contributes more than 35% and the processing industry accounts for 15.26% of the economy in Riau Islands with oil and gas commodities. In addition to the mining sector, community economic activities are dominant in the agriculture, plantation and forestry sectors. Riau Islands economic growth continued to decline in the period 2011–2014, then increased in 2014. During the period 2011–2014, the economic performance of the Riau Islands had an average growth rate of 6.31%.\\n\\nIn 2017, the manufacturing sector formed the largest GDP per share in the province, forming around 36.8% of the total GDP per share of the province. Based on the main commodities, mineral fuels, machinery and electrical equipment remain the mainstay trade of the Riau Islands. This type of commodity has not changed significantly compared to previous years. This needs to be considered given the expansion of the market must also be accompanied by an expansion of commodities both in quality and type.\\n\\nThe second largest sector is the Construction industry, forming around 18% of the total GDP sector. The development of the number of construction businesses in the Riau Islands fluctuated considerably during the period 2008–2010. In 2010 the number of construction companies in the province was 1,570, with the value of construction completed (revenue) of Rp 5,483\\xa0billion. Number of National Labor Force Survey Results show that the number of residents working in the construction sector has fluctuated from time to time. As many as 43,232 people were recorded in February 2009, then decreased in February 2010 to 29,932 people, again increased in August 2010 to 50,833 people, then decreased in February 2011 to 58,211 and again increased in August 2011 to 59,755 people. Because the Riau Islands is a new developing province and almost half of the existing human resources come from outside the Riau Islands, this has caused housing needs in the Riau Islands to be out of proportion to their availability. This condition also seems to have caused housing costs to rise in the Riau Islands relatively faster than in other regions. The results of the National Socio-Economic Survey show that on average the expenditure per capita of the population for rental costs/housing contracts is the highest type of expenditure for non-food commodities, and the figure tends to increase every year. This fact is in line with the increasing frequency of commodity rental prices in the Riau Islands.\\n\\nThe third largest sector is the mining industry. Riau Islands is the largest bauxite producing region in Indonesia. This can be seen from the number of bauxite mining companies. Since 2008, the number of bauxite mining companies has always been the highest compared to other mining companies, although the number has always dropped from 2008 to 2010. In 2009 the number of bauxite companies fell by 37 companies to 32 in 2010. This decline also had an impact on the decline in the number of workers and output produced by this sector. The tin company is the second largest company in the Riau Islands after bauxite. Tin companies also have the same situation as bauxite companies that are experiencing a decline. The tin company which initially had 25 companies in 2009 decreased to 22 companies in 2010.\\n\\nA small but significant sector in the province is the agriculture sector, forming around 3.5% of the total GDP sector. Despite having limited agricultural land, and production of food crops (mainly rice), the Riau Islands have not been able to meet the needs food for its population. This problem is caused by rice productivity that is still low. Cassava plants have the highest productivity, then sweet potato and rice plants are ranked third. In 2011, rice productivity in the Riau Islands reached 3.16 tons per hectare, far below the productivity of cassava and sweet potatoes, which amounted to 10.83 tons per hectare and 7.75 tons per hectare, respectively. When viewed from the harvested area and rice production in 2011, it experienced a very small increase as well as productivity. Rice productivity in 2010 was 3.15 tons per hectare, cassava was 10.82 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 7.72 tons per hectare. The increase in productivity of rice and cassava was only 0.01 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 0.03 tons per hectare. Corn and peanut crops are food crops in Riau Islands with low productivity during 2010–2011. Whereas for corn productivity in 2010 amounted to 2.13 tons per hectare decreased to 2.12 tons per hectare in 2011. While for peanuts the productivity remained, at 0.92 tons per hectare. Decrease in corn productivity is due to the harvested area for maize also has decreased, besides it is also the effect of pests that cause disruption of corn pests. Plantation and horticultural crops are types of plants that are quite potential to be cultivated in Riau Islands. This is based on the high price of agricultural products produced by these two types of businesses. As shown by the NTP (Farmer Exchange Rate) data, only estate and horticultural farmers have almost certainly an index value above 100. This condition is of course caused by the still higher price of goods produced by farmers compared to the price of goods needed, both for consumption and the cost of production. Production of rubber plants in 2011 experienced a very high increase of 118 percent. While coconut plants experienced a very small increase of 2.4 percent. As for fruit production, in 2011, only jackfruit and banana increased, where jackfruit production increased by 5 percent and banana production increased by 50 percent, compared to production in 2010. As for the production of pineapple, durian, orange and rambutan decreased in 2011.\\n\\nThe island of Natuna located in the north-eastern part of the province is home to the largest natural gas field in Indonesia (estimated to 1.3\\xa0billion m3). The field was discovered in 1973 by Agip. In 1980, the Indonesian state-owned oil company Pertamina and Exxon formed a joint venture to develop Natuna D-Alpha. However, due to the high  content the partnership was not able to start production. In 1995, the Indonesian government signed a contract with Exxon but in 2007, the contract was terminated. In 2008, the block was awarded to Pertamina. The new agreement was signed between Pertamina and ExxonMobil in 2010. Correspondingly, the field was renamed East Natuna to be geographically more precise. In 2011, the principal of agreement was signed between Pertamina, ExxonMobil, Total S.A. and Petronas. In 2012, Petronas was replaced by PTT Exploration and Production. As of 2016, negotiations about the new principal of agreement have not finalized and consequently, a production sharing contract is not signed. The area around the gas field is currently disputed between Indonesia and China.\\n\\nInfrastructure \\nFrom 2016 until 2020, the central government has outlined more development plan for the province. In 2017, the Indonesian Ministry of Public Works and People\\'s Housing has allocated around Rp. 500 million (US$36\\xa0million) for the development of infrastructure in the Riau Islands, which includes building new infrastructure as well as improving existing infrastructure in the province. Meanwhile, in 2019, the Riau islands provincial government has also allocated a budget of around Rp. 15,5\\xa0trillion (US$1\\xa0billion) that is allocated from the province\\'s Regional Revenue and Expenditures Budget. This is an increase from 2018\\'s annual budget, which is around Rp. 13,9\\xa0trillion (US$980\\xa0million). The government continues to work towards accelerating maritime development (both economy and tourism) in Indonesia\\'s foremost and outermost regions, one of which is in the Riau Islands province to support economic development, tourism, and marine resources in the Riau Islands.\\n\\nEnergy and water resources \\n\\nElectricity distribution in the state are operated and managed by the Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN). According to the Indonesian Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, as of 2017, there are 240 power plants in the Riau Islands, consisting of 2 steam power plant, 1 Solar power plant and 237 diesel power plant. Currently, the largest power plant in the Riau Islands is the Tanjung Kasam power plant in Batam, which has a capacity of 430 MW. It started operating in 2012. The power plant supplies around 25% of the total electric needs in Batam and the surrounding region. As of 2017, there are still around 104 villages in the province that is not fully electrified yet. In response, PLN has allocated around Rp. 751\\xa0billion (US$5.3\\xa0million) to build new power plants in the province with a total capacity of 45.500 KW. The location of the power plants will be scattered at several points such as in Natuna Regency. It also aimed that by 2020, all villages in the Riau Islands will be fully electrified.\\n\\nAll pipes water supply in the province is managed by the Riau Islands Municipal Waterworks (Indonesian: Perusahaan Daerah Air Minum Kepulauan Riau – PDAM Kepri). Reliable water supply is one of the main problem faced by the people of the Riau Islands. The province has often faced a shortage in clean water, mostly due to drought during the dry seasons. In response, the Indonesian government is currently constructing several dams across the province to anticipate water shortage in the future. Examples of dams that are being constructed are the Sei Gong Dam in Galang Islands, Batam, which as a capacity of 11,8\\xa0million m3 of water. Construction of the dam has finished in 2018 and is predicted to begin operation in 2019. Another dam that is also under construction is the Sei Busung Dam in Bintan. It is slated to begin operation 2021 and would have a water capacity of 100 million m3 .\\n\\nInternet and telecommunication \\nIn 2018, the household internet broadband penetration in the Riau Islands is 70%, which is above the Indonesian national figure around 54.86%, according to the survey results from the Indonesian Internet Service Providers Association (Indonesian: Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia) (APJII). Nonetheless, there are still many regions in the Riau Islands that has limited or no internet access, especially around the outlying regions of Anambas and Natuna Islands. Efforts have been taken by the government to improve internet access in the region, such as the construction of the Palapa ring, which is a massive, nationwide internet network using fiber-optic wires that will provide high-speed internet connection throughout the nation. The project aimed to make all the capital cities of regencies and municipalities in Indonesia connected with broadband or high-speed internet infrastructure. The idea was preceded by the difficulties of the outermost, rural, and disadvantaged regions in Indonesia in obtaining adequate telecommunications access. The project work process began in 2017. Currently Palapa Ring construction has been completed and has also been inaugurated. A number of Indonesian telecommunications operators have begun cooperating with the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information Technology so that the internet network can be accessed smoothly. The Palapa Ring network was completed in late 2019 and was inaugurated by the Indonesian president Joko Widodo on 14 October 2019.\\n\\nPresently, the mobile telecommunication penetration in the outlying regions of the Riau Islands such as Natuna and Anambas are increasing due to the improvement of telecommunication infrastructure compared to the previous years. Several Indonesian network providers such as XL Axiata and Telkom Indonesia has started building more BTS tower around the region to increase network coverage around the region. XL Axiata has been present in Anambas and Natuna since 2008 with 2G services that use satellite connections and then upgraded to 3G services. In March 2019, XL Axiata inaugurated the 4G data network in the Anambas Islands, by using the West Palapa Ring backbone, in collaboration with the Telecommunications and Information Accessibility Agency (BAKTI) in using the West Palapa Ring network. While in 2018, Telkomsel strengthens 4G services in Natuna Regency and Anambas Islands Regency by building two new 4G base transceiver stations. With the deployment of 4G network infrastructure in the country\\'s border areas, Telkomsel now operates 89 BTS tower in Natuna and Anambas, including eight 4G BTS tower.\\n\\nTransportation\\n\\nLand \\n\\nAs most of the Riau Islands consists of oceans and outlying islands, land transportation is only limited to the larger islands in the province, such as Batam and Bintan.  As of 2014, there are 4,954\\xa0km (3078\\xa0mi) of connected roadways in the Riau Islands, with 334\\xa0km (208\\xa0mi) being national highways, 512\\xa0km (318\\xa0mi) being provincial highways and the rest being city/regency highways. Most of the main roads in the Riau Islands has been paved, but there are still road sections that remain unpaved, especially in the outlying regions. Despite this, efforts has been taken by the government to improve road infrastructure in the regions, such as building more roads and improve existing roads, as well as building new bridges to connect river and islands in the province.\\n\\nAs in other provinces in Indonesia, the Riau Islands uses a dual carriageway with the left-hand traffic rule, and major cities in the province such as Batam and Tanjung Pinang provide public transportation services such as buses and taxis along with Gojek and Grab services. The Tengku Fisabilillah Bridge which connects Batam and Tonton Island is currently the longest bridge in the Riau Islands. It stretches for 642 meters and is a cable-stayed bridge with two 118 m high pylons and main span 350 m. The bridge is part of the Barelang Bridge, a chain of 6 Bridges of various types that connect the islands of Batam, Rempang, and Galang, Riau Islands that was constructed in 1992 and finished in 1997 and was inaugurated by former Indonesian president B. J. Habibie, who oversaw the project in construction, aiming to transform the Rempang and Galang islands into industrial sites (resembling present-day Batam). Travelling from the first bridge to the last is about 50\\xa0km and takes about 50 minutes. Over time the bridge sites have grown more into a tourist attraction rather than a transportation route. The Tengku Fisabilillah Bridge will be surpassed as the longest bridge in the province by the Batam-Bintan Bridge, which is still under the planning stage. Construction is expected to start in 2020 and finish in 3 to 4 years time. The Batam-Bintan bridge will have a length of around 7\\xa0km (4\\xa0mi).\\n\\nPresently, there is no toll road in the Riau Islands. However, the government has announced a plan to build a new toll road in Batam which would connect Hang Nadim International Airport in the eastern part of the island and the Batu Ampar area in the northern part. The toll road will have a length of 19\\xa0km (12\\xa0mi) and will be constructed with various construction methods. About 5.2 kilometers of the toll road will elevated while the rest will be at grade.\\n\\nAir \\n\\nThe province is served by several airports, the largest being Hang Nadim International Airport in Batam. Originally developed to handle diversions of aircraft from Singapore Changi Airport in case of an emergency, it has sufficient facilities for wide-body aircraft such as Boeing 747s. The airport has the longest runway in Indonesia and the second longest runway in Southeast Asia, after Kuala Lumpur International Airport, at 4,214 metres (13,825\\xa0ft) long. The airport serve flights to major Indonesian cities such as Jakarta, Medan, Surabaya and Palembang, as well as some international destinations such as Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and cities in China such as Shenzhen and Xi\\'an. Due to its proximity to Singapore, many people who is travelling abroad usually choose to go to Changi Airport in Singapore since it serves more destinations to other countries compared to Hang Nadim International Airport or Soekarno–Hatta International Airport in Jakarta.\\n\\nThe second-largest airport in the province is the Raja Haji Fisabilillah International Airport in Bintan. It mostly serves flight to Jakarta and destinations within the province such as Batam and Natuna. Other airports in the province are the Dabo Airport in Singkep, Raja Haji Abdullah Airport in Karimun, Letung Airport and Matak Airport in the Anambas Islands and Raden Sadjad Airport in the Natuna Islands. Raden Sadjad Airport is currently being developed as a military airbase due to territory dispute between Indonesia and China on the waters off the coast of the Natuna Islands. Additional facilities, such as aircraft hangars, ILS, refueling hangar are also currently being added.\\n\\nAs the closest neighbour of Singapore and to realise that Soekarno–Hatta International Airport is fully used, Lion Air is developing hangars in Batam Island and Garuda Indonesia is developing a new airport, with runway and maintenance facilities so as to make a new air hub in Bintan Island.\\n\\nSea \\n\\nDue to the fact that the Riau Islands is an archipelago province located in an archipelago country, water transport becomes the main type of transportation. Inter-island connections are often contacted by water transport. This type of water transport includes ferries, canoes, speedboats, freight boats, etc. This ships consists of a ship operated by the state-owned Pelni company as well as private vessels. The main ports are located in Batam and Bintan. There largest cargo port is the Port of Batu Ampar in Batam. It serves cargo ships to and from Batam and has a capacity of 1000 container.\\n\\nMajor cities such as Batam and Tanjung Pinang serves international ferry routes to Singapore and Malaysia. Ferries connect Batam to Singapore, Bintan, and Johor Bahru (Malaysia). Five ferry terminals are on Batam: Batam Harbour Bay Ferry Terminal, Nongsapura Ferry Terminal, Sekupang, Waterfront City, and Batam Center Ferry Terminal. Connections to Singapore are by way of Harbourfront and Tanah Merah Ferry Terminals run by Singapore Cruise Centre (SCC). While in Tanjung Pinang, the Sri Bintan Pura Harbour is the largest harbour in Bintan. This port connects the city of Tanjung Pinang with ports to the north (Lobam port and Bulang Linggi port), with islands to the west, such as Tanjung Balai Karimun, Batam, and islands to the south such as Lingga and Singkep islands. For international ferry services, the port of Sri Bintan Pura also has transportation links to Singapore (HarbourFront and Tanah Merah) and Malaysia (Stulang Laut).\\n\\nHealthcare \\n\\nHealth-related matters in the Riau Islands is administered by the Riau Islands Health Agency (Indonesian: Dinas Kesehatan Provinsi Kepulauan Riau). According to the Riau Islands branch of the Indonesian Central Agency on Statistics, as of 2016, there are around 28 hospitals in the Riau Islands which consists of 13 state-owned hospitals and 15 private hospitals. According to the Riau Islands provincial government, there are 87 clinics in Riau Islands as of 2018, of which 70 of them are already accredited, while the remaining 17 clinics are not yet accredited. The number of hospitals and clinics in the Riau Islands are still far below the ideal level, according to the Ombudsman of the Republic of Indonesia.\\n\\nThe most prominent hospital is the Riau Islands Regional General Hospital (Indonesian: Rumah Sakit Umum Daerah Kepulauan Riau) in Tanjung Pinang, which is the largest state-owned hospital in the province. Other prominent hospital in the province is the Santa Elisabeth Hospital in Batam and the Embung Fatimah Regional General Hospital which is also located in Batam. Due to lack of adequate health facilities in the province, many people usually travel to neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Singapore to get medical treatment as these countries has better medical infrastructure compared to the Riau Islands.\\n\\nEducation \\n\\nEducation in the Riau Islands, as well as Indonesia in a whole, falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Culture (Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan or Kemdikbud) and the Ministry of Religious Affairs (Kementerian Agama or Kemenag). In Indonesia, all citizens must undertake twelve years of compulsory education which consists of six years at elementary level and three each at middle and high school levels. Islamic schools are under the responsibility of the Ministry of Religious Affairs. The Constitution also notes that there are two types of education in Indonesia: formal and non-formal. Formal education is further divided into three levels: primary, secondary and tertiary education. Indonesians are required to attend 12 years of school, which consists of three years of primary school, three years of secondary school and three years of high school.\\n\\nAs of 2019, there are 1,621 schools in the Riau Islands, which consists of 1,051 government-owned schools and 570 private schools. There are several international schools in the Riau Islands, which are mostly located in Batam and the surrounding area, due to its significant expatriate populations, such as Sekolah Global Indo-Asia, The Independent School Batam, Australian Intercultural School, Sekolah Djuwita Batam, etc. Most of the teachers that worked in these international schools are English-educated teachers from Singapore, Malaysia, United Kingdom, Australia, United States and Philippines.\\n\\nThere are around 40 universities in the Riau islands, both public and private universities. Public universities in the Riau Islands falls under the responsibility of the Ministry of Research and Technology (Kementerian Riset dan Teknolog) or the Ministry of Religious Affairs for Islamic universities. Notable public universities in the province is the Raja Ali Haji Maritime University and the Sultan Abdurrahman Islamic College in Tanjung Pinang, and the Batam State Polytechnic in Batam. There are at least one international university in the Riau Islands, which is the Batam International University located in Batam.\\n\\nDemographics\\nAccording to the 2000 national census results (released in 2021 by the Indonesian Central Agency on Statistics), the Riau Islands province had a population of 2,064,564 people, spread throughout five regencies and two cities, and consisting of 1,053,296 males and 1,011,268 females. This makes the Riau Islands the 26th most populated province in Indonesia. The population in the province was predicted to increase to 2,768,000 by 2030, although this figure has since been revised downwards. In 2020, the population density in the Riau Islands was 251.7 people per km2 . The city of Batam is the most populated administrative division in the province, with a number of 1,196,400 people in 2020, while the Anambas Islands Regency is the least populated in the province, with just 47,400 people. Most of the population of Riau Island is concentrated on the island nearest to Singapore, such as Batam and Bintan.\\n\\nEthnicity \\n\\nRiau Islands is a very diverse and multi-ethnic province. Owing to its proximity to Singapore, many people from other parts of Indonesia has migrated to the province. As of 2009, the ethnic groups in Riau Island consist of Malays (35.60%), Javanese (18.20%), Chinese (14.3%), Minangkabau (9.3%), Batak (8.1%), Buginese (2.2%) and Banjarese (0.7%).\\n\\nThe Malays are the largest ethnic group with a composition of 35.60% of the entire population of the Riau Islands. They are the native people of the Riau Archipelago. From the ancient times, the Riau Archipelago is considered the hub of Malay cultures. In the past, several Malay kingdoms and sultanates existed in the archipelago, the most notably being the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. A major sub-group of the Malay inhabiting the province is the Orang laut (sea people).  The Orang laut are Malays who are Nomadic in nature and have a rich marine culture. Presently, many Orang laut have settled in coastal areas of the province. The Orang laut are encompasses of numerous tribes and groups inhabiting the islands and estuaries in the Riau-Lingga Archipelagos, the Tudjuh Archipelago, the Batam Archipelago, and the coasts and offshore islands of eastern Sumatra, southern Malaysia Peninsula and Singapore. The geographical condition of the Riau Islands, which has almost 99% of its area as water, has made quite a number of Orang Laut groups living in this area. In the Riau Islands, the Orang laut are usually found in islands and river mouths. The Orang laut are boat-dwelling tribe with main livelihoods as fish finders and other marine animals, such as tripang (sea cucumber). This subsystem economic model is the characteristic of their culture. Since the implementation of the policy of relocation of settlements by the Indonesian Government in the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the customs of the Orang laut are gradually disappearing.\\n\\nOther ethnic group are mostly immigrants coming from different parts of Indonesia. Due to its proximity from Singapore, Riau Islands have become a melting pot for different ethnic groups coming from other parts of Indonesia. The Javanese is the dominant ethnic group of the immigrants, forming 18.2% of the total population. The Javanese who stayed here are mostly due to the Transmigration program enacted by the Dutch during the colonial period to reduce the overpopulated Java and continued until the end of the New Order. Another notable immigrants are the Minangkabau (Minang), who mostly originated from West Sumatra. Owing to its rantau (migration) culture, many Minangkabau people has migrated away from their homeland. The history of the Minangkabau migration in West Sumatra to the Riau mainland and the Riau Islands has been recorded to have lasted a very long time. When the means of transportation were still using the river, many Minang people migrated to various cities such as Tanjung Pinang and Batam. Other ethnic groups, such as the Batak from North Sumatra, the Banjarese from South Kalimantan and the Buginese from South Sulawesi also inhabit the province, albeit to a lesser extent.\\n\\nThe Chinese is the third largest ethnic group in the province, forming 14.3% of the total population. Chinese traders have frequented the region since at least the 13th century, during the Yuan dynasty. The mention of Longyamen (simplified Chinese: 龙牙门; traditional Chinese: 龍牙門; pinyin: lóngyámén), which means \"Dragon\\'s Tooth Strait\" in Chinese, first appeared in the Yüan shih in 1320. In 1325, Longyamen sent a mission to China with a memorial and tribute. The nearby island of Bintan had sent an earlier mission in 1323. Thus Longyamen was already known to the Yuan court before 1320. Another place named Longyamen appears in 1225 in Zhao Rugua’s text. It has been argued that this place was Lingga, south of Riau, and that the 14th-century Longyamen was in that vicinity. It is more probable, however, that the Song text referred to a different place from the Yuan texts. There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that Longyamen was Singapore in the 14th and 15th centuries. Presently, the Riau Island is one of the province in Indonesia that has the largest number of Chinese population. The capital of the Riau Islands, Tanjung Pinang, is one of the city that has the largest percentage of ethnic Chinese population among other cities in Indonesia, amounting to 58.86% of the total population. Until now the majority of Tanjung Pinang\\'s economy is driven by the ethnic Chinese community. They not only controlled the small or medium-scale economy, but also developed into large-scale businesses such as shipbuilding, housing, restaurants and hospitality. In addition to moving in the economy, there are some who become politicians, people\\'s representatives, political figures and even civil servants. Most of the Chinese in Tanjung Pinang, as well as the Riau Islands in a whole trace their ancestors from Fujian, hence most of them are of Hokkien origin, while significant population of Teochew and Cantonese origins also exist in the Riau Islands.\\n\\nLanguage \\nIndonesian is the official language of the state, as well as the province. However, several varieties of Malay are spoken in the province. There are fifteen different varieties of Malay spoken in the Riau Islands, most of which are mutually intelligible with Indonesian, which is a standardized form of Malay. The Riau Islands are considered the birthplace of the modern Malay language, though it was the classical Malaccan Malay of the Johor court rather than Riau Malay that formed the basis of the standard Indonesian language. The common Riau Islands Malay dialect, which is spoken in major cities such as Tanjung Pinang and Batam is similar to the Malay used in Johor, Malaysia, although it is much more influenced by the Indonesian language. It served as the lingua franca of the province.\\n\\nThe Karimun Regency has several dialects namely the Kundur dialect and the Bintan-Karimun dialect. In general, it uses the Johor-Riau dialect. The main characteristic of this dialect is the suffix \"A\" which sounds as \"E\". The word /saya/ and /apa/ (\"I\" and \"What\" respectively) will be pronounced as /saye/ and /ape/ in the Johor-Riau dialect, which is similar to the Malay used in Peninsular Malaysia. The dialects used in the Bintan Regency are the Bintan-Karimun dialect, the Malang Rapat-Kelong dialect which is used in Malang Rapat village and Kelong village and the Mantang Lama dialect in Mantang Lama Village in Kijang. The word pronunciation is similar to the Malay used in Tanjung Pinang and Karimun. The Malay used in the Lingga Regency is also similar to the Malay used in the Karimun and BIitan Regency. The variety of Malay spoken in the province\\'s northernmost regencies, Anambas and Natuna, is not only mutually unintelligible to the standard Indonesian language, but also mutually unintelligible to the Malay varieties spoken in Bintan and Karimun. The Anambas Malay dialect slightly resembles the Pontianak Malay dialect spoken in West Kalimantan and the Belitung Malay dialect spoken in Bangka-Belitung, especially their vocabulary and phonology. For example, kitak or ketak which means you, wan which means grandma and suduk which means spoon are both used in Anambas and Pontianak. The Natuna Malay people spoke a dialect of Malay that is influenced by Terengganu Malay and Pahang Malay that are spoken in the Malaysian states of Terengganu and Pahang respectively, as most of the people living there trace their origins from the eastern coast of the Malay Peninsula. Historically, the Anambas and Natuna Malays spoke the Terengganu Malay, but its speakers (mostly elderly) are rapidly diminishing and replaced by the local Malay dialects on the islands (to a lesser extent, the usage of standard Indonesian was also the cause of the diminishment of native dialect speakers). The Orang Laut people also spoke their own variety of Malay which is still related to the Malay spoken in the Batam-Bintan area.\\n\\nTraditionally, the Malay language is written in Jawi script (locally known in Indonesia as \"Arab-Melayu\"), an Arabic-based writing. However, the use of Jawi is diminishing rapidly, being replaced by the Latin script introduced by the Dutch during the colonial era. Today, the Jawi script are primarily used for religious and cultural activities. Road signs and government buildings signs in the Riau Islands are also written in this script, usually written along the Latin script.\\n\\nMost of the Chinese in the Riau Islands spoke a variety of Hokkien, a local variant of the Min Nan Chinese variety, as most of the Riau Islands Chinese are of Hoklo descent. The Riau Islands Hokkien is related to the Hokkien spoken in mainland Riau, such as the town of Bagansiapiapi and Selat Panjang, as well as the Hokkien spoken in Central and Southern Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore. Together, they are known as the Southern Malaysia Hokkien. This dialect is based on the Quanzhou dialect, which originated from the city of Quanzhou in Fujian, China. It is markedly distinct from Penang Hokkien and Medan Hokkien, which are based on Zhangzhou dialect, another Hokkien dialect originated from the city of Zhangzhou, also in Fujian. Other varieties of Chinese are also spoken in the province, such as Teochew, Hainanese, Hakka and Cantonese, albeit to a lesser extent compared to Hokkien. Hokkien serves as the lingua franca of the Chinese people in the Riau Islands. Most of the Chinese varieties spoken in the region has been greatly influenced by Malay and Indonesian, especially their vocabulary.\\n\\nOther ethnic groups who migrated from other parts of Indonesia brought their own language, such as the Javanese language spoken by the Javanese, Minangkabau language spoken by the Minangkabau and different varieties of Batak spoken by different sub-groups of the Batak people.\\n\\nIndonesian is widely used as the national language. Most formal education, and nearly all national mass media, governance, administration, judiciary, and other forms of communication in the Riau Islands, are conducted in Indonesian. It is also used for inter-ethnic communication. Indonesian is spoken as the first language in major cities such as Batam and Tanjung Pinang, while it is spoken as a second language elsewhere in the province. The Chinese people in the Riau Islands uses Indonesian as their third language, with Hokkien or other Chinese varieties being used as their first language and the local Riau Malay as their second language.\\n\\nReligion\\n\\nThe local Malay people of the Riau region since ancient times and even until the present-day is considered as a society that is accommodating, friendly, and welcome to immigrants who come to bring new cultures and religions, both from within and outside the country. The example are immigrants from India with Hinduism, from China with Buddhism and Confucianism, from Europe with Christianity and Catholicism, as well as other migrants from various ethnic groups in the Nusantara archipelago.  Based on the composition of the population of the Riau Islands which is full of diversity with different socio-cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds, it is basically an asset for the Riau Archipelago itself. The religions embraced by the inhabitants of the province are very diverse, including Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.\\n\\nAs of 2016, Islam is the dominant religion in the province, forming 77.56% of the total population. Islam is generally adhered by the ethnic Malays, Javanese, Minangkabau, Banjars, Bugis, Sundanese and some Batak sub-group. Islam has entered the region since at least the 12th century. Contact between the indigenous population and Muslim traders from the Arabian Peninsula, Persia and India did occur for the first time in the northern Sumatra region because of its strategic position to traders stopover at that time. This condition strengthens the indication that the Islamization process is expected to have taken place since the contact took place so that a community was formed where the Arabs who settled in the village were married to local residents thus forming Muslim communities. Islam is generally adhered by the ethnic Malays, Javanese, Minangkabau, Banjars, Bugis, Sundanese and some Batak sub-group. Several Muslim organizations in Indonesia has branches in the Riau Islands, such as Muhammadiyah and the Nahdlatul Ulama.\\n\\nChristianity forms the second-largest religion group in the province, forming around 14.67% of the total population. The two largest Christian domination in the Riau Islands are Protestantism and Catholicism, forming around 12.21% and 2.46% of the total population respectively. Most of the people who adhered Protestantism are from Batak sub-groups (specifically Batak Toba, Karo and Simalungun), Nias, Chinese, and immigrants from North Sulawesi, Maluku and Papua, while most of the people who adhered Catholicism are immigrants from East Nusa Tenggara. The province does not have its own Catholic Diocese. Instead, it is served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pangkal-Pinang, which is based in Pangkal-Pinang, Bangka Belitung Islands.\\n\\nBuddhism and Confucianism forms a significant minority in the province, forming around 7.55% and 0.17% respectively. They are mostly adhered by the Chinese. Lastly, Hinduism only forms around 0.05% of the total population, which is mostly adhered by Balinese immigrants and Indonesians of Indian descent.\\n\\nCulture \\nThe culture of the Riau Islands is strongly influenced by the culture of the Malays and the Chinese people. Some ethnic groups, for example Javanese, Balinese, Bugis, Batak, and European culture also influenced the culture of the province. The culture of the Riau Islands is also influenced by the culture of Islam. The Malay people that inhabits Riau Islands is also overwhelmingly adhered to Islam. In addition to Islam, the culture of the Riau Islands has also been influenced by the other religions, such as Buddhism, Christianity and Confucianism. However, as the Riau Islands is considered as the home of the Malay people and part of the Malay world, the culture of the Riau Islands mostly relate to the culture of the Malay people themselves.\\n\\nWhat is typical of the Malay people is the designation of a nickname for a specific person in a family. The first child in a Malay family is called long or sulung, the second child is called ngah/ongah, the third child is called cik and the youngest child is called cu/ucu. The nickname is usually followed by a word that describes the physical characteristics of the person concerned, for example cik itam, which means a third child with a dark/black characteristic. This culture can only be found in the Riau Malay community, both in the Riau Islands as well as mainland Riau.\\n\\nA typical Riau Malay kampung (village) are led by a village chief called the penghulu. Presently, the penghulu is a village administrator chosen based on government regulations. Besides the penghulu there is also a leader in the religious sector called imam. This imam takes care of all matters relating to religion, such as religious studies and lessons, marriage/ divorce/reconciliation, the distribution of inheritance, collection of zakat and others. Thus the penghulu accompanied by the imam are the leader of the kampung.\\n\\nIn the kampung, most of the local people knew each other, because the villagers had a strong sense of attachment to each other. Harmony is a characteristic of the community of these kampung. The existence of harmony is not caused by external coercion in the form of harsh sanctions, but it does arise from a conscience that is influenced by the norms that live in the community. Starting from the movements, attitudes and traits are influenced by these factors. Avoiding things that can cause disgrace and shame is a motivating factor for continuing to act and be kind to others and such feelings are stronger than feelings of sin. All actions must be maintained so as not to cause \"discordant eyes\", \"discordant ears\", \"discordant manners\".\\n\\nArts and Performance \\n\\nVarious forms and types of arts found in the Riau region, namely theater, dance, music, singing, and literature. Artists in urban areas generally feel alien to traditional arts. Therefore, an appreciative link is needed by introducing all types and forms of traditional arts in urban areas. Thus, contemporary art that grows, lives, and develops in urban areas will have a solid and tidy foundation in contributing to national art.\\n\\nIn the late 1890s, the Rusydiah Club was founded, an association for scholars, writers, and cultural figures. This association was established in the Riau Islands, precisely on Penyengat Island which at that time was the center of the government of the Sultanate of Riau-Lingga. In essence, this association is a cultural institution that includes art, performance and literature. Its activities began with the commemoration of Islamic holidays, such as Maulud Nabi, Isra-Mikraj, Nuzulul Quran, Eid al-Fitr, Eid al-Adha, and others which later developed to the publication of books by members of the association. All activities are supported by royal facilities in the form of the Marah Ahmadi Khanah Polar library and two Jawi printing presses, namely Mathba‘at al Ahmadiyah and Mathba‘at al Riauwiyah. The Rusydiah Klub is the first association of scholars in Indonesia. This association is not mentioned in national history, because of the lack of careful collection of historical material, or maybe because there is no input from those who know much about it. Rusydiah Club left behind a valuable heritage of creativity in the form of books of literature, religion, history and linguistics.\\n\\nThe Riau region has long been an area of trade traffic in neighboring countries, so Riau has given birth to diverse cultural figures and colors. This is a burden, as well as a historical-geographical blessing. Riau seems to be a field of association of various artistic potentials, in which there are cultural influences in neighboring countries and other Indonesian cultures. Riau Malay art is very diverse, because small groups that exist in the community are also developing. The fact shows, the arts in Riau and the arts in Malay countries such as Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei Darussalam mutually complement and influence each other. Likewise, Malay cultural regions such as Deli, Langkat, Serdang and Asahan in North Sumatra, Jambi, West Kalimantan, and others, were also affected by the Minangkabau, Mandailing, Bugis and Javanese cultures. Cultures influence that come from outside Indonesia such as India (Hindu-Buddhist), Arabic (Islam), Chinese, and Siamese influence. The flexibility of Malay culture is in line with the historical development and geographical location of Riau, making Riau very rich with a variety of artistic expressions. The development of Malay culture in Riau, in turn, can enrich national culture.\\n\\nBaju Kurung is one of the traditional clothes of the Malay community in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and southern Thailand. Baju Kurung is often associated with women. The hallmark of the clothes brackets is the loose design on the holes in the arms, abdomen, and chest. When worn, the bottom of the clothes bracket is parallel to the groin, but for rare cases there are also those that extend to knee level. Shirt brackets are not fitted with buttons, but are almost similar to t-shirts. Shirt brackets are also not collared, each end is crochet. Some parts are often decorated with gold embroidery. At first, the clothes of the brackets were usually worn for the great ceremony of Malay by women in the kingdom, used together with songket cloth to be used as a scabbard, various gold jewelry, and a small bag or fan. Since the majority of Malay communities embraced Islam, many women who wear clothes in brackets match them with the hijab, although there are also those who do not use them. Now the clothes of brackets are widely worn by ordinary people, used by children to read the Quran, or ladies to go to the market, without including accessories that seem luxurious.\\n\\nHowever, the main traditional dress of the people of the Riau Islands is the Kebaya Labuh and the Teluk Belanga. The Kebaya Labuh are specifically worn by women. It is typically worn at the time of traditional ceremonies and official events of the local community. The hallmark of Kebaya Labuh and Teluk Belangga traditional clothing is the length of the kebaya to cover the knees with the shape of the kebaya looking wide and open. Kebaya Labuh is often combined with batik cloth such as cual fabric. For the wedding, the groom wore a head covering called Tanjak. The spindle is a rectangular songket that is folded into a headband. A distinctive feature of the Teluk Belanga custom clothing is a plain color paired with shades of color, a sheath worn over the knee that acts as a scarf, a headband made of songket cloth called the tanjak. The custom attire of Kebaya Labuh and Teluk Belangga is complemented by a headdress called a peak which is a head covering made of square songket shaped like songkok or peci. Typically, the skirt is only used for formal ceremonies or events such as feasts and custom ceremonies. However, these decorations are usually only worn on formal occasions such as death or marriage. Occasionally, Teluk Belangga clothing is usually accompanied by a peci. For women, the Kebaya Labuh is usually combined with batik and also with a scarf.\\n\\nThe Mak yong is one of the traditional dances that can be found in the Riau Islands. Mak Yong is a traditional theatrical art of the Malay community which is still sustainable today. Although it is not often performed, every service is always welcomed by enthusiastic residents, especially those who love Malay culture and native art. Mak Yong performances are usually performed by groups of dancers and musicians, who combine various religious elements, theatrical, dance, music, vocals and texts. The main characters are male and female, both are performed by female dancers. The Mak yong performance is accompanied by musical instruments such as fiddle and drums. In the Riau Islands region, the Mak Yong oral tradition has been exhibited since several centuries ago and has spread to Bangka, Johor, Malacca and Penang. In the Riau Islands, this oral tradition developed rapidly during the sultanate era. Mak yong theater performing arts is played with dances, songs and jokes that are intertwined in a story line, the players are 20 people, women wearing glittering costumes.\\n\\nZapin is a Malay traditional dance that can be found in both the Riau Islands and mainland. This dance is one of several types of Malay dance that still exists today. According to history, in the beginning this dance was a dance of entertainment in the palace after being brought from Hadramaut in Yemen by Arab traders in the early 16th century. At that time the country of Johor became a substitute for the role of Malacca as an international port in the 16th century. This can be seen from the development of Zapin dance creations that are identical with Malay culture and in terms of rhyming. Artists and culture are able to make traditional art, not stopping but full of dynamics that are always acceptable in every circumstance. This traditional dance is both educational and entertaining, and is used as an Islamic da\\'wah medium through Zapin songs that are sung. The accompanying music consists of fiddles, tambourines, drums and small drum percussion instruments called marwas or maracas. The Zapin dance focuses more on teamwork rather than individual efforts. Before the 1960s, Zapin was only performed by male dancers but now it is usually danced by female dancers or both male and female.\\n\\nThe Malemang dance is a traditional Riau dance by the people of Bintan. It originated back in the 12th century in Tanjungpisau. Originally, it was only performed at the Royal Palace of the Kingdom of Bentan in Bukit Batu, Bintan. As the kingdom collapsed, this dance became a folk entertainment show. At present, Malemang Dance is displayed in various events, including festivals. In the show, the dancers demonstrate their ability to take something (handkerchief, change, etc.). They do this by flexing (standing up, bending backwards). From this skill then this dance is called malemang or melemang. In Tanjungpisau, this dance is better known as the Melemang Bintan Penaga Dance.\\n\\nArchitecture\\n\\nIn Malay culture, the art of development also has characteristics that are reflected in the symbols of traditional houses that are full of meaning. At present, Malay traditional houses can still be found in several regions in the Riau Archipelago, Peninsular Malaysia, Brunei and other Malay-populated countries. In traditional Malay society, a house is an intact building that can be used as a family residence, meeting place and shelter for anyone in need. Therefore, traditional Malay houses are generally large, usually with six poles, six porch poles and twelve poles or porch houses. Of the several forms of the house, all are almost identical, both stairs, doors, walls and room layout are identical. In addition to being large, the Malay house is also always in the form of a stage or a house with a hole, facing towards the sunrise. In general, the types of Malay houses include dwellings, halls, houses of worship and storage houses. The naming is adjusted to the function of each building.\\n\\nRiau Malay traditional house buildings are generally given a variety of decorations, starting from the door, window, ventilation to the top of the roof of the building, the decoration is adjusted to the meaning of each carving.  Additionally, these houses are also given a pattern. The pattern of a Riau Malay house is largely derived from nature, consisting of flora, fauna, and space objects. These things are designed in certain forms, either in their original form such as backdrops, forest flowers, or in abstracted or modified forms so that they no longer appear in their original form, but simply use their name.\\n\\nThe Limas Potong house is one of the traditional houses of the Malays inhabiting the Riau Archipelago. Limas Potong is a stilt house, like a traditional house in Sumatra in general. Height of about 1.5 meters from the ground surface. The walls of the house are made of brown planks, while the roof is red zinc. The doors, windows and pillars on the front of the house are painted in white oil. Limas Potong has five main parts, namely terrace, front room, center, back (bed), and kitchen. The front of the house is used to display historical photographs of this traditional house, the living room contains a typical Malay bridal diorama, and the back is a room that contains a mosquito net that integrates with the kitchen.\\n\\nOne of the most famous traditional house of the people of the Riau Islands is the Belah Bubung traditional house. This house is also known as the Rabung house or the Bumbung Melayu house. The name Belah Bubung was given by the Malays because the shape of the roof was split. The size of the house built is determined by the ability of its owner, the richer a person is, the bigger the house and the more variety of decoration. However, wealth is not an absolute determinant. The most important consideration in making a home is harmony with the owner. To determine whether or not a house is compatible, the owner calculates the size of the house by cubits, from one to five. The veins are: snake swimming, pursuing ripples, ripples climbing beetles shelter, debt out of debt changed debt, and five debt has not been affected. The best measure is if it is right on the count of ripples to climb the shade beetle.\\n\\nTraditional weapon\\nBadik Tumbuk Lado is a traditional weapon originating from the Riau Islands. Badik itself is a term for traditional weapons which is known among the Bugis community and some regions in Sumatra. Meanwhile, Tumbuk Lada is a traditional weapon of the Malay people. No wonder the Badik Tumbuk Lado has similarities with weapons from other Malay-populated region. The Riau Islands are inhabited by various races and ethnicity. However, the majority of indigenous people are Malay people. Therefore, the culture of the Riau region has a lot in common with other indigenous Malay regions.  Badik Tumbuk Lado is a type of stabbing weapon measuring 27 to 29\\xa0cm and its width is around 3.5 to 4\\xa0cm. This weapon is not only used by the people of Jambi, and also has similarities with the Buginese Badik, it only differs in the shape and motive of the holster. Not only domestically, Malaysia also has the same traditional weapons, both in name and form. This is inseparable from the background of Malay communities spread throughout Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and along the Malay peninsula. Similar to the keris, badik is also one of the identities that characterizes the Malay people. Until now the Badik Tumbuk Lado is still used by the people of the Riau islands to do production work such as farming or hunting. Some local customs also still maintain the badik as a complement to men\\'s custom clothing.\\n\\nThe Jenawi is a type of sword that became the most popular traditional weapon in the Riau area. This sword was often used by Malay warlords in the face of his enemies. The sword has a length of about 1 meter so it is often used for close combat. Jenawi sword is similar to a typical Japanese katana. Historians and cultural experts argue that this weapon originated from ancient Japan which experienced acculturation with Malay culture. Regardless of this opinion, the sword of genius remains a Malay people\\'s identity on the national scene.\\n\\nCuisine \\n\\nCuisine in the Riau Islands are mostly similar to the one in Peninsular Malaysia, owing to its similar culture. There are also some dishes that is influenced by other parts of Indonesia, such as Java. Due to its cultural diversity, the people of the Riau Islands has developed a unique dishes that cannot be found in other parts of Indonesia. The Riau Islands cuisine is strongly influenced by the culture of the Malay, Indian and Chinese. Some foods are also influenced by the culture of the Javanese, Balinese, Bugis, other ethnic groups in Sumatra and Borneo, as well as European cultures, especially the British and Dutch.\\n\\nOne of the most popular dish in the Riau Islands is its variety of the Nasi lemak, with some notable differences compared to the variety found in neighboring Malaysia and Singapore. In archipelago region like Riau Islands, usually seafood are used to accompany nasi lemak, such as ikan bilis (anchovy), ikan tamban (Sardinella longiceps), ikan selar kuning (Selaroides leptolepis), sotong or cumi-cumi (squid) or small Prawns. The Riau islands traditional nasi lemak is quite similar to Malaysian version; it comes as a platter of coconut rice wrapped in banana leaf, with cucumber slices, small dried anchovies (ikan bilis), roasted peanuts, hard boiled egg, and hot spicy sauce (sambal). The Riau islands version however, comes with an addition of small fish locally known as ikan tamban, usually fried with sambal chili paste and very crispy, the whole fish is edible. Prawns and Squids are also commonly stir-fried in chili paste as sambal udang or sambal cumi.\\n\\nAnother notable dish that can be found in the Riau Islands is the laksa. Laksa or Lakse in local dialect is a kind of noodle food mixed with typical Chinese and Malay spice blend. Lakse has a round white and slightly thick noodle shape. The name of lakse is taken from Sanskrit which has a lot meaning. It shows that lute noodle is made with various spices. Lakse in the Riau Islands presented in several kinds, one of which is a typical Anambas lakse which is included in the category of lakse curry with a fatty and spicy sauce and rich in spices. One of the most typical mackerel soups of Batam, popularly known as the Batam Fish Soup (Indonesian: Sup Ikan Batam). This Batam Fish soup is served with a slice of mackerel fish that had previously been separated from its bones. This piece of fish is smeared with egg whites to remove the fishy smell, then cooked with spices and mixed with starfruit and green tomatoes. Pieces of white or green mustard greens are also incorporated into this soup.\\n\\nThe Bak kut teh (肉骨茶) is another dish found in the Riau Islands, usually consumed by the Chinese people in the province. the dish can only be found in the region as well as neighboring Singapore and Malaysia. Bak kut teh means meat tea bone. Bak kut itself is pork ribs, while the word teh, which means tea in Hokkien, comes from either the dish brown sauce which is similar to the color of a tea, or that it was originally served with tea to mollify the taste.. This gravy is a pork broth, with spices such as garlic and strong pepper.\\n\\nSnacks and drinks such as the teh tarik and curry puff can also be found in the province. Teh Tarik is not originally an original beverage from the Riau Islands. This drink is familiar in Southeast Asia especially easily found in Malaysia and Singapore. However, in the Riau Islands, such as Batam, Tanjung Pinang and Tanjung Balai Karimun, this drink is commonly available everywhere. The condition of the Riau Islands, which is close to Malaysia and Singapore has made Teh Tarik to spread around the Riau Islands. Curry puff, also known as epok-epok in the local Riau Islands Malay, is a famous local snack that can be commonly found everywhere in the province. This pastry is made from flour and potatoes is very easy to find in the Malay world. In Malaysia or Singapore, for example. Epok-epok is better known as karipap. Whereas in Java, the pastry is usually called pastel. Epok-epok is a pastry made from flour dough which is printed with a special mold, with a filling typical for epok-epok. In the past, epok-epok are usually made of spicy potatoes, but now many other ingredients have been added to epok-epok as variations of flavor.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links \\n \\n http://www.navegar-es-preciso.com/news/islas-anambas/\\n http://www.navegar-es-preciso.com/news/archipielago-de-tambelan/\\n\\n \\nStates and territories established in 2004\\n2004 establishments in Indonesia\\nProvinces of Indonesia\\nStates and territories established in 2002\\n2002 establishments in Indonesia', 'The  Chicago Bears season was the franchise\\'s 99th season in the National Football League, as well as the first under head coach Matt Nagy, who took over the job after John Fox was fired in 2017 following a three-year tenure.\\n\\n2018 marked their first winning season since 2012 and their first playoff appearance since 2010. The Bears ensured improvement over their 5–11 record from the previous season in Week 10 when they defeated their division rival Detroit Lions. In Week 12, they scored their eighth win of the season, also against the Lions, ensuring that the Bears would not have a losing season for the first time since 2013. With a Week 14 win over the Los Angeles Rams, the Bears clinched their first winning season since 2012. With their Week 15 win over the rival Green Bay Packers, the Bears clinched their first playoff berth and division title since 2010. They finished the season 12–4 with a win over the Minnesota Vikings. The season ended in disappointment as they lost to the defending Super Bowl champion Philadelphia Eagles, who they had helped get into the playoffs in the last game of the season, in the NFC Wild Card Game 16–15 on January 6, 2019 at Soldier Field after Cody Parkey\\'s game-winning field goal was blocked and hit the crossbar twice as time expired.\\n\\nOffseason\\n\\nOrganizational changes\\nOn January 1, 2018, head coach John Fox was fired after spending three seasons with the Bears, compiling a 14–34 record. Two days later, the Bears began interviewing for the position starting with defensive coordinator Vic Fangio, followed by Minnesota Vikings defensive coordinator George Edwards (January 4), Vikings offensive coordinator Pat Shurmur and New England Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels (January 5), Philadelphia Eagles quarterback coach John DeFilippo (January 6), and Kansas City Chiefs offensive coordinator Matt Nagy (January 7). The day after his interview, Nagy was ultimately hired as the 16th head coach in franchise history.\\n\\nNagy\\'s first assistant coach hiring was Harry Hiestand as offensive line coach, joining the team on January 10; Hiestand had spent the last six seasons with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish at the same position, while also working as the OL coach for the Bears from 2005–2009. Two days later, the Bears replaced offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains, who departed the Bears to join the Miami Dolphins in the same position on January 4, with former Oregon Ducks head coach Mark Helfrich, while also hiring three new coaches: former Bears assistants Chris Tabor and Charles London as special teams and running backs coaches, respectively, and Mike Furrey as wide receivers coach. Tabor served as an assistant special teams coach with the team from 2008–2010 before joining the Cleveland Browns as the special teams coordinator, while London had spent the last three seasons as the running backs coach of the Houston Texans. A former wide receiver, Furrey was Nagy\\'s New York Dragons teammate in the Arena Football League in 2002, which was followed by an eight-year NFL career, including a 2006 campaign in which he ranked second in the league in receptions with 98; he was most recently the head coach of the Limestone Saints football team. During the day, Fangio signed a three-year extension to remain in Chicago. On January 13, the Bears hired New York Giants tight ends coach Kevin M. Gilbride to serve in the same role. Brock Olivo, a former colleague of Nagy in Kansas City and Denver Broncos special teams coordinator, joined the Bears as an assistant special teams coach on January 19.\\n\\nIn January, head trainer Nate Breske was released by the team, as were strength coaches Jason George and Rick Perry. In their places, the Bears hired Browns trainer Andre Tucker and Washington State University strength and conditioning coach Jason Loscalzo, respectively.\\n\\nOn February 27, the Bears formally announced their full staff, with every defensive coach returning to their posts for the 2018 season. Other newcomers included Brad Childress as a senior offensive consultant, Donovan Raiola as assistant offensive line coach, Brian Ginn and Mike Snyder as offensive quality control coaches, Shane Toub as an offensive assistant, and Bill Shuey as defensive quality control coach. Childress was the head coach of the Minnesota Vikings before joining the Chiefs in 2013, and served as their co-offensive coordinator alongside Nagy in 2016. He had intended to retire after 2017, but elected to rejoin Nagy in Chicago. A former center, Raiola was on the Bears\\' practice squad in 2009 and worked with Hiestand in Chicago before following him to Notre Dame as a graduate assistant for two years. Ginn was Nagy\\'s wide receiver at Delaware before becoming a coach for the school. Shuey was a colleague of Nagy\\'s during their tenures with the Eagles and was most recently working as the Widener Pride\\'s defensive coordinator. Toub, the son of Chiefs and former Bears special teams coordinator Dave Toub, was a graduate assistant for the Illinois Fighting Illini under ex-Bears head coach Lovie Smith in 2017.\\n\\nRoster changes\\n\\nThe Bears entered free agency with 25 free agents, including 19 unrestricted, four restricted, and two exclusive rights free agents.\\n\\nAcquisitions\\nOn January 1, the Bears signed wide receivers Demarcus Ayers, Tanner Gentry, and Mekale McKay, offensive linemen Travis Averill and Will Pericak, tight end Colin Thompson, and defensive back Doran Grant to reserve/futures contracts. Nine days later, Montreal Alouettes cornerback Jonathon Mincy signed with the Bears; in 32 games in the Canadian Football League, Mincy recorded 108 tackles with three interceptions and two forced fumbles. He was named to the Eastern Division All-Star team in 2017.\\n\\nThe NFL\\'s legal tampering window, during which teams could negotiate with incoming unrestricted free agents, opened on March 12. During the period, wide receivers Allen Robinson and Taylor Gabriel, tight end Trey Burton, and kicker Cody Parkey expressed their intentions to sign with the Bears. Robinson tore an anterior cruciate ligament in the first game of 2017 with the Jacksonville Jaguars; in the three prior years, he recorded 2,831 receiving yards and 22 touchdowns, and was named to the 2015 Pro Bowl. During the 2017 Atlanta Falcons season, Gabriel caught 33 passes for 378 yards and a touchdown. Burton, who played for the Eagles in 2017, had 23 receptions for 248 yards and five scores. In Super Bowl LII, he threw a touchdown pass to quarterback Nick Foles. Parkey, who worked with Tabor during his tenure with the Browns, converted 21 of 23 field goals with the Miami Dolphins in 2017. The four signings were officially announced on March 14.\\n\\nWhen free agency began on March 14, quarterback Chase Daniel signed a two-year deal with the Bears; Daniel worked with Nagy in Kansas City, establishing himself as a liked backup quarterback with the Chiefs and New Orleans Saints. During the so-called second wave of free agency a few days later, the Bears signed defensive end/linebacker Aaron Lynch from the San Francisco 49ers and quarterback Tyler Bray from the Chiefs. Lynch, who played with Fangio in his 2014 rookie season, registered six sacks in his rookie campaign and 12.5 in his first two NFL seasons before a PED suspension and calf injury cut his production the last two years. Bray was Alex Smith\\'s backup in Kansas City under Nagy.\\n\\nOn April 3, Arizona Cardinals guard Earl Watford signed with the Bears, becoming the third ex-Cardinal on Chicago\\'s offensive line alongside Bradley Sowell and Bobby Massie.\\n\\nDepartures\\nOn February 20, the Bears announced they were releasing linebacker Jerrell Freeman and declining a 2018 option on offensive lineman Josh Sitton; in 2017, Freeman was placed on injured reserve after suffering a torn pectoral muscle in the first game of the year, followed by a ten-game suspension for using performance-enhancing drugs. Sitton missed the last two games of the season with an ankle injury. Six days later, linebacker Pernell McPhee and safety Quintin Demps were cut. McPhee recorded 14 sacks in three seasons with the Bears, but also struggled with injuries. Demps was benched following the emergence of Eddie Jackson and Adrian Amos as the new starters during the 2017 season. Outside linebacker Willie Young, who only played four games in 2017 due to a torn triceps, was released on February 28. Cornerback Marcus Cooper was released on March 14, but was brought back by the team thirteen days later on a one-year contract; he started the first four games of the 2017 season before suffering a back injury and losing his starting spot.\\n\\nDuring free agency, various free agents signed with other teams. On March 15, linebacker Christian Jones and kicker Cairo Santos signed with the Detroit Lions and New York Jets, respectively; in 2017, Jones set career highs in tackles (84) and sacks (two) in addition to forcing and recovering a fumble. Santos played two games for the Bears before suffering reaggravating a groin injury. Defensive end Mitch Unrein, who recorded 32 tackles and 2.5 sacks in 2017, was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on March 16. Andrew DePaola joined the Oakland Raiders for 2018 and became the highest-paid long snapper in the league. On March 22, offensive lineman Tom Compton, who started five games at guard for the Bears in 2017, signed with the Minnesota Vikings, with receiver Kendall Wright doing the same eight days later. In early April, wide receiver and restricted free agent Cameron Meredith was offered a two-year, $10 million contract by the New Orleans Saints, which the Bears elected to not match after five days.\\n\\nNFL Draft\\n\\nThe Bears entered the draft needing to address positions like linebacker, defensive back, and offensive line. Such positions were suggested in various mock drafts from those like Sean Wagner-McGough of CBSSports.com, Matt Eurich of 247Sports.com, and Lorin Cox of USA Today as they projected Notre Dame guard Quenton Nelson, Florida State defensive back Derwin James, and Boston College linebacker Harold Landry, respectively.\\n\\nWith the eighth-overall pick, the Bears selected Georgia Bulldogs linebacker Roquan Smith, reuniting him with 2016 first-round pick and former Bulldog linebacker Leonard Floyd. In 2017, the Butkus Award winner helped lead Georgia to the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship. In the second round, Chicago opted to fill the offensive positions as the team drafted Iowa center James Daniels and Memphis receiver Anthony Miller. In 2017, Daniels was honorable mention for the All-Big Ten Conference team as he helped lead an Iowa offense that averaged 190.2 passing yards and 139.2 rushing yards per game. Although he played center in college, the Bears elected to move him to guard to start his NFL career. Miller, whose selection was made possible when the Bears traded up to the 51st-overall pick in a trade with the New England Patriots that sent the 105th overall and a 2019 second rounder to New England, recorded 1,448 receiving yards and 16 touchdowns in the 2016 and 2017 seasons; during the latter, he averaged 3.47 yards per route run, fourth-best among receivers in the draft.\\n\\nThe third and final day of the draft saw rounds four through seven. With their fourth-round pick, the Bears drafted Western Kentucky linebacker Joel Iyiegbuniwe; a Chicago native, Iyiegbuniwe played both inside and outside linebacker in college; in his final season, he had 116 tackles, 11.5 tackles for loss, two forced fumbles, two sacks, and a fumble recovery. The fifth round saw defensive tackle Bilal Nichols of Delaware be selected; a fellow Delaware alumnus like Nagy, Nichols recorded 5.5 sacks and 6.5 tackles for loss in 2017, earning him a spot on the first-team All-Colonial Athletic Association team. Chicago filled the gap at edge rusher by drafting Utah defensive end Kylie Fitts; Fitts struggled with injuries throughout his college career, but racked up 23 tackles, three tackles for loss, three sacks, and a forced fumble in 2017. In the seventh round, the Bears drafted another receiver and Bulldog in Javon Wims; in 2017, Wims led the Bulldogs with 45 catches for 720 yards and seven touchdowns.\\n\\nAfter the draft, the Bears signed fifteen undrafted free agents: running back Ryan Nall (Oregon State), wide receivers Garrett Johnson (Kentucky) and Shaq Roland (West Georgia), offensive lineman Dejon Allen (Hawaii), defensive linemen Abdullah Anderson (Bucknell) and Cavon Walker (Maryland), linebackers Nyles Morgan and Andrew Trumbetti (Notre Dame) and Elijah Norris (Shepherd), cornerbacks Michael Joseph (Dubuque) and Kevin Toliver II (LSU), safety Nick Orr (TCU), and punter Ryan Winslow (Pittsburgh).\\n\\nOn May 10, every draft pick minus Smith signed their rookie contracts with the team. Smith\\'s signing was delayed due to a conflict between his agency CAA Football and the Bears. Much of the debate centered on language in the contract dictating whether Smith\\'s guaranteed money would return to the team if he was suspended due to the NFL\\'s new rule outlawing contact leading with the helmet. While CAA argued for a clause that would protect Smith\\'s guaranteed money, the Bears suggested their decisions would be determined by the league\\'s own actions, a situation that was exacerbated by skepticism surrounding the rule and the high frequency of tackles in Smith\\'s role on the field. After missing Training Camp in July and early August, Smith signed a four-year deal with the Bears on August 14.\\n\\nDraft trades\\nThe Bears traded their third-round selection (70th overall), and their first-, third- and fourth-round selections in 2017 (3rd, 67th, and 111th overall) to San Francisco in exchange for San Francisco\\'s first-round selection in 2017 (2nd overall).\\nIn 2017, the Bears traded their second-round selection (36th overall) to Arizona in exchange for Arizona\\'s 2018 fourth round selection (115th overall), as well as their 2017 second, fourth, and sixth round selections (45th, 119th, 197th overall).\\n\\nOffseason activities\\n\\nOffseason workouts began on April 3; as the Bears entered the offseason with a new head coach, they were permitted to start workouts earlier than other teams. Also thanks to having a new coach, the team held a voluntary veteran minicamp from April 17–19.\\n\\nThe Bears held a veteran minicamp in late April. After its conclusion, the team released McKay and signed receiver Marlon Brown and defensive end Nick Williams. In 2013, Brown caught 49 passes for 524 yards and seven touchdowns for the Baltimore Ravens, but saw his playing time decrease over time as the receiving corps was bolstered with new players. Williams last played for the Chiefs and Dolphins in 2016.\\n\\nIn May, Rookie Minicamp was held from May 11–13. After its conclusion, the Bears signed five tryout players: wide receiver Matt Fleming, offensive linemen Jeremi Hall and Matt McCants, and defensive backs John Franklin III and Tyrin Holloway. Fleming played football and ran track for Division III school Benedictine University, recording 45 receptions for 731 yards and 10 touchdowns in 2017. Hall started 25 games for the South Florida Bulls in 2016 and 2017, while McCants, a sixth-round draft pick in 2012 by the New York Giants, returned to the Bears after playing for them in 2016. After transferring to Western Illinois for his final season in 2017, Holloway played four games for the Leathernecks and had three interceptions. Franklin, a former quarterback at Florida State, attracted attention when he appeared on the Netflix series Last Chance U during his time at East Mississippi Community College. He later played receiver for Auburn and Florida Atlantic. In conjunction with the signings, the Bears released Averill, Morgan, linebacker Howard Jones, and offensive lineman Cameron Lee.\\n\\nThe Bears conducted ten offseason team activities (OTAs) on May 15–17, May 22–24, and May 29 – June 1. A mandatory minicamp involving the entire roster took place on June 5–7. Linebacker Kasim Edebali, who was attending the camp on a tryout and played for Bears GM Ryan Pace in New Orleans, signed with the team after it ended. Other post-camp transactions included signing linebacker Josh Woods, who went undrafted after playing safety for Maryland from 2014 to 2017, and releasing Holloway and Roland.\\n\\nTraining Camp at Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais began on July 21 and ended on August 11. On August 15, days before their preseason game against each other, the Bears visited Englewood, Colorado for a joint practice with the Broncos.\\n\\nDuring camp, the Bears made the following roster moves: on July 23, Hall was released and Florida State linebacker Ro\\'Derrick Hoskins was signed to take his place; a receiver swap occurred on July 26 when Fleming was waived in favor of Albany Empire player and Arena Football League Offensive Rookie of the Year Malachi Jones; on July 27, defensive end Bunmi Rotimi was released and former Saints offensive lineman Jack Allen was signed; however, Allen was released on August 4 and his roster spot taken by fellow O-lineman Kaleb Johnson, a former Chiefs player; Johnson\\'s slot would also be replaced a week later by Chiefs running back Knile Davis.\\n\\nStaff\\n\\nFinal roster\\n\\nPreseason\\nOn February 13, the NFL announced that the Bears will play the Baltimore Ravens in the Pro Football Hall of Fame Game on Thursday, August 2, at the Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium in Canton, Ohio. The remaining preseason games were revealed on April 11.\\n\\nSchedule\\n\\nGame summaries\\nThe Hall of Fame Game began on a poor note when Chase Daniel\\'s pass was intercepted by Chuck Clark, though DeAndre Houston-Carson responded by intercepting a deflected throw from Robert Griffin III, which set up Daniel\\'s four-yard touchdown pass to Michael Burton. The Ravens answered with Griffin\\'s five-yard touchdown throw to Maxx Williams, followed by Kamalei Correa intercepting Daniel and a field goal by Kaare Vedvik to give them the lead. Daniel was substituted for Tyler Bray after the first half; despite the touchdown to Burton, he also had two picks and a passer rating of 38.8. Early in the second half, DeShon Elliott forced Demarcus Ayers to fumble and Baltimore\\'s Bronson Kaufusi recovered. Lamar Jackson eventually threw a seven-yard touchdown to Hayden Hurst. In the fourth quarter, Cody Parkey kicked a 22-yard field goal, followed by Bray completing a ten-yard touchdown to Tanner Gentry. The Bears attempted a two-point conversion, but failed to score and ultimately lost by one point.\\n\\nWith the exception of certain players like Allen Robinson, Taylor Gabriel, and Jordan Howard, Chicago\\'s first-string offense made its preseason debut against the Cincinnati Bengals. Starting quarterback Mitchell Trubisky was present for just eight plays. Defensively, despite a Kyle Fuller interception returned for touchdown and Taquan Mizzell\\'s one-yard touchdown run, the unit also allowed two touchdowns. After being down 23–14 at halftime, the Bears scored 13 unanswered points via two Parkey field goals and Demarcus Ayers\\' three-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter. However, Jeff Driskel threw the go-ahead touchdown to Auden Tate with slightly over two minutes left to put the Bengals up 30–27, and Parkey missed the game-tying field goal with 45 seconds remaining.\\n\\nThe Bears rebounded from the two-game losing streak by winning the next two matchups. Against the Denver Broncos, the starting offense saw more playing time, though the game began poorly when Trubisky fumbled in the end zone and was tackled by Bradley Chubb for a Denver safety. The Broncos added three points on Brandon McManus\\' 26-yard field goal, but the first stringers bounced back on Trubisky\\'s seven-yard touchdown pass to Trey Burton. Denver answered with two consecutive touchdowns, the second of which was set up when Trubisky was intercepted by Justin Simmons. Parkey kicked a 43-yard field goal to make the score 20–10 at halftime. Although McManus converted a 35-yard field goal to increase the margin to 13 points, Daniel led a fourth quarter comeback with two- and twelve-yard touchdown passes to Mizzell and Ben Braunecker, respectively, to win 24–23.\\n\\nAgainst his former team in the Chiefs, Matt Nagy elected to bench his starters, a move that was viewed as unusual since the third official week of the preseason is often used by teams to play their first stringers as a dress rehearsal. The second-string offense excelled in its first three drives as it scored on every series: Benny Cunningham scored first on a 13-yard touchdown run, followed by Daniel throwing 29- and seven-yard touchdown passes to Kevin White and Javon Wims. After the first quarter, Daniel maintained a perfect 158.3 quarterback rating, which ended at 149.5 when he was rotated out by halftime when the Bears led 24–10. On defense, the Bears allowed ten points on the Chiefs\\' first two drives, but eventually prevented them from scoring until the fourth quarter. The Chiefs scored ten additional points and Parkey added a 19-yard field goal as the Bears triumphed 27–20.\\n\\nIn the final game of the preseason against the Buffalo Bills, the Bears saw success throughout the first three quarters as Doran Grant, Ryan Nall, and Knile Davis scored on a 33-yard pick-six and 32- and one-yard touchdown runs, respectively, while Parkey kicked two field goals to put them up 27–3. In the fourth quarter, however, A. J. McCarron led the Bills to 25 unanswered points via three touchdown passes and a touchdown run. With 13 seconds remaining, he threw the game-winning pass to Keith Towbridge. The Bears could not recover and lost 28–27.\\n\\nTransactions\\nDuring the preseason, the Bears signed former Oregon long snapper Tanner Carew and released Andrew Trumbetti on an injury settlement. Later in the month, Earl Watford was waived.\\n\\nOn September 1, the team made extensive moves to whittle down its roster to 53 players, which included releasing the following players: Ayers, Bray, Carew, Davis, Edebali, Gentry, Grant, Mizzell, Nall, Dejon Allen, Abdullah Anderson, Jonathan Anderson, Rashard Fant, Bennie Fowler III, John Franklin III, Brandon Greene, Ro\\'Derrick Hoskins, John Jenkins, Garrett Johnson, Malachi Jones, Michael Joseph, Cre\\'Von LeBlanc, Matt McCants, Johnathon Mincy, Jordan Morgan, Elijah Norris, Nick Orr, Will Pericak, Colin Thompson, John Timu, Cavon Walker, Nick Williams, Ryan Winslow, and Josh Woods.\\n\\nMarlon Brown and tight end Adam Shaheen were placed on injured reserve on September 1 and 2, respectively. Brown suffered a concussion during the Chiefs game, while Shaheen sprained his right foot/ankle against the Broncos. Per the NFL\\'s injured reserve rules, those on IR may return to playing after the first eight games of the regular season.\\n\\nOn September 2, the Bears traded for decorated Oakland Raiders linebacker and 2016 Defensive Player of the Year Khalil Mack, who held out of training camp and other offseason activities due to a contract dispute. In acquiring Mack, the Bears sent first-round draft picks in 2019 (later used on running back Josh Jacobs) and 2020 (later used on cornerback Damon Arnette), a third-round pick in 2020, and a sixth-round pick in 2019 to Oakland; Chicago also acquired a 2020 second rounder and a conditional fifth rounder in the same draft. It is the Bears\\' first trade involving sending two first rounders since they did so for quarterback Jay Cutler in 2009. Mack and the Bears later agreed to a six-year extension worth $141 million, including a guaranteed $90 million, making him the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history. During the day, center Hroniss Grasu was released and Nick Williams was re-signed.\\n\\nFollowing the moves, the practice squad was filled out with ten players: Allen, Anderson, Bray, Gentry, Joseph, Mincy, Mizzell, Nall, Woods, and offensive lineman James Stone.\\n\\nRegular season\\n\\nSchedule\\nThe Bears\\' 2018 schedule was announced on April 19. The first two games took place in prime time as the Bears played week one on NBC Sunday Night Football and week two on ESPN\\'s Monday Night Football. Weeks ten to twelve saw three consecutive games against NFC North opponents, marking the Bears\\' first three-game divisional stretch since 2007. The second match of the slate, week eleven against the Vikings, was initially scheduled for Sunday afternoon before being flexed to Sunday Night Football. The following week\\'s game against the Lions was played on Thanksgiving Day, making the Bears the first team since the AFL–NFL merger in 1970 to play a Thursday afternoon game after playing on Sunday night. Through this stretch, they managed to win three division games in a 12-day span. The Bears\\' week seventeen game against the Vikings was flexed to 3:25\\xa0p.m. because of its impact on the playoffs.\\n\\nChicago wore its navy blue jerseys in six of the eight home games, along with the away whites in all but one road game. For the week six game against the Miami Dolphins and the week eleven matchup against the Vikings, the Bears wore orange jerseys for the first time since 2011. Week eight against the New York Jets saw the use of the 1940s throwbacks.\\n\\nGame summaries\\n\\nWeek 1: at Green Bay Packers\\n\\nIn the first game of the 2018 regular season, the Bears visited Lambeau Field to take on the longtime rival Green Bay Packers. Entering the game, the Packers led the all-time series 96–94–6, with the Packers having won all but three games since 2010. Leading up to the game, Matt Nagy announced the team would not have permanent team captains and instead opt for a rotating weekly system consisting of three players (one from the offense, defense, and special teams apiece), which was previously used by Nagy in Kansas City. As such, Mitchell Trubisky, defensive end Akiem Hicks, and running back/special teamer Benny Cunningham were named week one\\'s captains.\\n\\nAfter the Packers punted on the first drive, the Bears opened the Nagy era by running the T formation with their first offensive play; the formation was made famous by team founder and longtime head coach George Halas during the 1930s and 1940s, while the play itself was nicknamed \"Papa Bear Left\" in honor of him. Chicago eventually scored on a two-yard touchdown run by Trubisky to cap off an 86-yard series. Chicago continued its momentum with Cody Parkey\\'s 26-yard field goal after another Packers punt in the second quarter. During the quarter, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers suffered a knee injury and was replaced by DeShone Kizer, who lost a fumble to newly-acquired linebacker Khalil Mack while inside the Bears\\' ten-yard line; Mack also intercepted Kizer\\'s pass and returned it for a 27-yard touchdown to put the Bears up 17–0 at halftime, the team\\'s biggest advantage at Lambeau during the Brett Favre/Rodgers era. Chicago increased the advantage to 20–0 with Parkey\\'s 33-yard field goal. Rodgers returned shortly after, during which Mason Crosby kicked a 42-yard field goal. The Bears offense failed to score for the rest of the game as every drive ended with a punt minus a 32-yard field goal in the fourth quarter, while Rodgers threw touchdown passes of 39, 12, and 75 yards to Geronimo Allison, Davante Adams, and Randall Cobb, respectively. The touchdown to Cobb followed a near-interception by Fuller, who dropped the pass. With the score, Green Bay was up 24–23 with 2:13 left in the game. Although Trubisky led the offense into Packers territory, he was sacked by Nick Perry on fourth down and fumbled, losing the ball to Kenny Clark.\\n\\nIt is the fifth consecutive week one loss for the Bears and the tenth straight NFC North defeat. After leading by 20 points, the defeat is the second-largest blown lead in team history and the third such instance (the Bears also lost to the 1992 Minnesota Vikings and 2002 New Orleans Saints despite maintaining 20-point advantages in both games). In spite of the defeat, positives included Roquan Smith sacking Kizer on his first career NFL snap, fewer penalties than usual (five for 35 yards; in their last four games in Green Bay, the Bears averaged ten penalties for 106 yards), and a lack of turnovers allowed. Offensive lineman Bobby Massie stated, \"There\\'s a lot of things we did well. Nobody gave us a chance in that game. Just corrections that need to be made. We\\'ve got to finish stronger and things won\\'t be a problem.\"\\n\\nWeek 2: vs. Seattle Seahawks\\n\\nHoping to rebound from the loss in Green Bay, the Bears hosted the 0–1 Seattle Seahawks on Monday Night Football in week two. In 17 all-time games between the two, Seattle led the series 11–6, including winning the last four regular season meetings. Despite the result of the Packers game, history showed optimism for the Seahawks matchup as the Bears were 7–1 in the first game after a loss to Rodgers at Lambeau Field. Although mobile Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson led the NFL in passing touchdowns in 2017, he struggled in week one against the Broncos as he threw two interceptions, was sacked six times, and had just five rushing yards. Furthermore, he lost receiver Doug Baldwin to a knee injury, making the run game more crucial. With the exception of veteran safety Earl Thomas, Seattle\\'s defense was inexperienced and struggled against Denver; in his game preview, Sports Illustrated writer Andy Benoit expected the Seahawks to suffer difficulties against a misdirection-based Bears offense. Predicting a Bears victory, Benoit added that while Wilson will have over 50 rushing yards, the Seattle offense will be restricted to below 300 total yards. Running back Jordan Howard, nose tackle Eddie Goldman, and tight end/special teams player Ben Braunecker represented the Bears as team captains.\\n\\nAfter the Seahawks punted on the opening drive, the Bears once again scored on their first possession as Trubisky engineered a 96-yard drive that ended with a two-yard shovel pass touchdown to Trey Burton. Despite the early success, the quarterback struggled in the second quarter as he was intercepted on two consecutive drives, both by Shaquill Griffin, though the Seahawks could not capitalize as they were forced to punt on every ensuing series. On one drive, Wilson fumbled after Mack stripped him on third down. By halftime, both teams added field goals on their last drives (Parkey making a 25 yarder, Sebastian Janikowski converting a 56 yarder on the final play of the first half). After a scoreless third quarter, Trubisky threw a ten-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Miller to increase the advantage to 14 points. Although the margin returned to one score after Wilson completed a 19-yard touchdown to Tyler Lockett, the Bears scored again when Prince Amukamara intercepted Wilson\\'s pass and returned it 49 yards for a touchdown. On the Seahawks\\' next drive, Danny Trevathan sacked Wilson, who lost the ball and it was recovered by the Bears\\' Leonard Floyd. The Bears punted, followed by the Seahawks completing a 99-yard series with Wilson\\'s two-yard touchdown pass to Will Dissly with 14 seconds remaining in the game. Miller recovered the onside kick to secure the 24–17 win.\\n\\nThe defense ended the day with six sacks on Wilson from five players. Including the four sacks against Green Bay, the Bears had a league-high ten sacks after two games. \"Our theme this game was to play all four quarters and finish. I\\'m so glad that this was a team win and we got that bad taste out of our mouth last week,\" Amukamara said.\\n\\nWeek 3: at Arizona Cardinals\\n\\nIn week three, the Bears battled the Cardinals in State Farm Stadium for the first time since 2012, a game that ended in a 28–13 Bears victory. While the Cardinals won the latest game between the two in 2015 (a 48–23 win in Chicago), the Bears were victorious in the last two regular season games in Arizona. In the teams\\' historic meetings dating back to 1920, the Bears led the all-time series 58–28–6. To begin the 2018 season, the Cardinals struggled mightily on offense, especially in the first half: across the first two quarters of both games, they were outscored 40–0, had an NFL-worst 96 rushing yards on 32 carries for an average of 3 yards, and never crossed the 50-yard line into opposing territory. In contrast, the Bears\\' first-half team had 27 points against just 3 points allowed, while the defense allowed 150 yards on 56 plays (average of 2.7 yards), the lowest in the league. On the opposite side, Arizona\\'s defense saw the return of defensive end Markus Golden from an ACL injury in 2017, who – along with Chandler Jones – assisted the Cardinals in recording the most sacks in 2016. In Golden\\'s absence, Jones had an NFL-high 17.5 sacks in 2017, a situation that Chicago Sun-Times writer Mark Potash pointed out would prove a challenge for the Bears\\' tackles in their effort to protect Trubisky. Massie, Amukamara, and linebacker/special teamer Sam Acho were named team captains; Massie and Acho were former Cardinals, while Amukamara is an Arizona native.\\n\\nIn contrast to their first half woes in the first two games of 2018, the Cardinals opened the game by scoring on a five-play, 75-yard drive that ended with Sam Bradford\\'s 35-yard touchdown pass to Ricky Seals-Jones. The Bears attempted to respond by driving to the Cardinals\\' 13-yard line, but Trubisky was sacked for a 15-yard loss and Parkey missed a 46-yard field goal wide right. On Chicago\\'s next drive, Trubisky was sacked by Robert Nkemdiche and fumbled, losing the ball to Corey Peters. On the first play of the ensuing drive, Bradford threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to David Johnson to make the score 14–0 after one quarter; it was double the points scored by the Cardinals in weeks one and two combined. The Bears responded with a 71-yard series that reached the Cardinals\\' two-yard line, where Parkey kicked a 20-yard field goal. Trubisky\\'s troubles continued when he was intercepted by Tre Boston on the Bears\\' penultimate play of the first half. After the Bears punted on the first drive of the second half, the defense forced Bradford to commit three consecutive turnovers that the offense capitalized on with scoring drives: Bradford was intercepted by Eddie Jackson and Howard scored on a one-yard touchdown run, he threw another interception to Sherrick McManis which led to Parkey\\'s 41-yard field goal, he fumbled after being stripped by Mack and the fumble was recovered by Trevathan to set up Parkey\\'s go-ahead 43-yard field goal and make the score 16–14 in favor of Chicago. With four minutes remaining, backup rookie quarterback Josh Rosen relieved Bradford. Although he led the Arizona offense into Chicago territory, his pass for Christian Kirk was intercepted by Bryce Callahan. The Bears punted, but three straight runs forced the Cardinals to use all three timeouts as they got the ball back with 43 seconds left in the game. On the second play of the following possession, Rosen was picked off by Jackson, who returned the interception for a 35-yard touchdown before an offsides penalty on Mack nullified the score. Two plays later, Rosen was sacked by McManis to seal the win.\\n\\nWith the win, Chicago improved to 2–1, their first winning record since 2014. As the Packers and Vikings lost their respective games, the Bears also took over the NFC North lead for the first time since 2013.\\n\\nWeek 4: vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers\\n\\nIn week four, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers entered Soldier Field with a 2–1 record. In 58 total meetings since 1977, the Bears led the all-time series 38–20, but lost by more than 20 points in their last two games. On the other hand, the Bears won the last game between the two in Chicago in 2014. Although regular starting quarterback Jameis Winston was returning from a three-game suspension, the Buccaneers gave the start against the Bears to backup Ryan Fitzpatrick, who excelled in the first three games as he threw for over 1,200 yards with 11 touchdowns and a 124.8 passer rating. He also threw for over 400 yards in all three games, becoming the first quarterback in NFL history to have such a streak. However, a poor showing against the Pittsburgh Steelers in week three nearly resulted in his benching, implying he was \"on a short leash\" for the Chicago game. While the Bears defense had been successful so far, they were without cornerbacks Prince Amukamara and Marcus Cooper due to hamstring injuries, while Tampa Bay receivers Mike Evans, DeSean Jackson, and Chris Godwin had a combined 63 catches for 850 yards and nine touchdowns in 2018. As a whole, the Buccaneers offense led the league in total and passing yards, while also averaging 34 points per game. For Chicago\\'s offense, it faced a Tampa Bay defense that was ranked 29th in yards per pass play (7.9), but allowed just 3.6 yards per rushing play and only one rush of at least 25 yards. NBC Sports Chicago writer JJ Stankevitz stressed the importance of success in the red zone; although the Bears were 27th in red zone touchdown percentage with 40 percent, the Buccaneers allowed 88.9 percent of red zone plays to result in touchdowns. Burton, Jackson, and McManis were the Bears\\' captains.\\n\\nThe Bears scored quickly as Trubisky recorded a 23-yard run that set up a 39-yard touchdown pass to Burton on the opening drive. After three drives ended in punts, Trubisky threw a 14-yard touchdown to Allen Robinson. Chandler Catanzaro kicked a 30-yard field goal to start the second quarter, but Trubisky and the Bears answered with three straight unanswered touchdowns through the air of 9, 20, and 3 yards to Tarik Cohen, Josh Bellamy, and Taylor Gabriel. The final score saw a trick play that featured Daniel lining up beside Trubisky in the backfield, with Trubisky pitching the ball forward to Gabriel before faking the hand-off to Daniel. The play, nicknamed \"Willy Wonka\", had been devised by Nagy and the two quarterbacks. On Tampa Bay\\'s final drive for the first half, despite a 42-yard completion to Jackson, Fitzpatrick was intercepted by Jackson. The Bears closed out the half with Parkey\\'s 50-yard field goal. Fitzpatrick was pulled for Winston to start the second half, but Winston threw an interception of his own to Trevathan. Trubisky took advantage of the takeaway with his sixth touchdown pass of the game, another three-yard pass to Gabriel, making the score 45–3. Early in the fourth quarter, Winston threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to Cameron Brate, though Parkey converted a 46-yard kick to increase the margin to 38 points. Mack eventually tipped Winston\\'s pass and Aaron Lynch intercepted it; Daniel kneeled twice to end the game.\\n\\nIt was the Bears\\' first three-game win streak since 2013 as the team improved to 3–1. The 48 points scored were the most by the Bears since they recorded 51 against the Tennessee Titans in 2012, while the 38-point difference is the largest since a 41–3 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars that same year. Trubisky recorded a career-high 354 passing yards, six touchdown passes, and a 154.6 rating. The touchdown passes are the second-most in Bears history, one short of the record set by Sid Luckman in 1943. With his five touchdowns in the first half, Trubisky became the first Bears quarterback to accomplish the feat since Johnny Lujack in 1949, while also becoming the second player in NFL history to do so to five different receivers since Rodgers did it against the Bears in 2014. Each of the offense\\'s first five touchdown drives lasted no more than 3:34. After the game, Trubisky stated, \"Hopefully, this will be something I can look back on and say, \\'This is where it all started.\\'\"\\n\\nWeek 5: Bye week\\nEntering the bye week, the Bears had a 3–1 record at the top of the NFC North. Unlike previous Bears regimes, Nagy provided the team with a week off before returning to practice for week six, an approach used by former boss and Chiefs head coach Andy Reid.\\n\\nAt the break, the fourth-ranked defense led the league in sacks (18) and ranked second in turnovers forced (11), while the eight interceptions recorded (by seven different players) tied the Bears\\' totals across each season from 2015–2017. Along with the Tennessee Titans, the Bears defense had yet to allow a rushing touchdown.\\n\\nDuring the week, the Bears placed Acho on injured reserve after he tore a pectoral muscle in week four. To take his roster slot, the team signed offensive lineman Bryan Witzmann on October 8; Witzmann started 13 games for the Chiefs in 2017 and had been with the Vikings until his release three days prior.\\n\\nWeek 6: at Miami Dolphins\\n\\nDonning the orange jerseys, the Bears visited Miami to play the 3–2 Dolphins, in the first of four consecutive games against the AFC East. In 12 all-time games, the Dolphins led the series 8–4, including winning their latest meeting in 2014, though the Bears won the last game in Miami in 2010. Hours before the game, the Dolphins announced starting quarterback Ryan Tannehill would miss the contest with a shoulder injury and was replaced by Brock Osweiler. Osweiler won both of his career starts against the Bears with the Denver Broncos and Houston Texans in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The Dolphins were also playing sans defensive end Cameron Wake; with Miller and Amukamara returning from their injuries, Lorin Cox described the game as having \"the potential to go quite poorly for Miami.\" Cohen, Trevathan, and Bellamy were the team captains.\\n\\nAfter two drives that ended with punts, the Dolphins capitalized on two Bears penalties as Osweiler threw a five-yard touchdown pass to Nick O\\'Leary. The Bears\\' next drive ended when Cohen was stopped on fourth and one. In the second quarter, the Bears attempted to score from the Dolphins\\' one-yard line, but Howard fumbled after bumping into Burton and Kiko Alonso recovered. On the ensuing drive, however, Osweiler\\'s deep pass was intercepted by Fuller. Trubisky kneeled to end the half with the Bears trailing 7–0. In the second half, the Bears opened with three consecutive scoring drives as Trubisky threw a nine-yard shovel pass touchdown to Burton, followed by a 12-yard touchdown to Robinson after Fuller recorded another interception, and Cohen scored on a 21-yard run. Jason Sanders kicked 50- and 25-yard field goals to give the Dolphins six points in the third quarter. During Chicago\\'s next series, Trubisky completed a 50-yard pass to Cohen and guided the offense to the Dolphins\\' three-yard line, where he threw a touchdown pass to Cohen. However, Burton was penalized for offensive pass interference and pushed the team back ten yards. On the next play, Trubisky\\'s pass for Braunecker was intercepted by T. J. McDonald. Miami mounted an 80-yard drive that concluded when Osweiler threw a screen to Albert Wilson, who ran 43 yards for the touchdown; Kenny Stills caught Osweiler\\'s pass on the two-point conversion to tie the game. The Bears responded with Trubisky\\'s 29-yard touchdown to Miller, to which the Dolphins struck on one play as Wilson scored on a 75-yard touchdown reception. With two minutes left in regulation, Cohen lost a fumble on the Bears\\' 32, but the Dolphins punted. After a kneel, overtime began. On Miami\\'s first drive, they reached Chicago\\'s one-yard line before Kenyan Drake was stripped by Hicks and Goldman recovered the loose ball. The Bears reached the Dolphins\\' 35-yard line, but Parkey\\'s 53-yard field goal went wide right. Sanders scored the game winner on a 47-yard kick as time expired.\\n\\nDespite the unit\\'s success at the start of the season, the Bears defense struggled against the Dolphins. After recording 18 sacks and allowing of 294.5 yards per game in weeks one through four, the defense failed to sack Osweiler and surrendered 541 yards; Osweiler also threw for a career-best 380 passing yards. Jackson attributed the defense\\'s struggles to the weather and various errors; he commented, \"This wasn\\'t Chicago Bears-style defense we\\'re used to playing. We knew it was going to be hot, we knew it was going to be a tough one. We made a lot of mistakes that we\\'ve got to come in and correct.\"\\n\\nWeek 7: vs. New England Patriots\\n\\nThe Bears hosted the New England Patriots in week seven. In 13 all-time games, the Patriots led the series 9–4 and had won every game since 2002. Patriots quarterback Tom Brady excelled against the blitz (passer rating of 138.4 under such circumstances) but his rating dropped to 87.2 when pressured, a situation that Stankevitz argued would be crucial for the Bears defense. USA Today Bryan Perez added Brady\\'s passer rating fell when he held onto the ball for longer than 2.5 seconds, so forcing him to bide his time before throwing was another factor of importance. Besides Brady, New England\\'s offense also featured a rushing attack led by rookie Sony Michel, who entered the game with the third-most first down conversions in the league. On the other hand, the Patriots were without tight end Rob Gronkowski, who was sidelined with ankle and back injuries. For the Bears offense, scoring in the red zone was crucial, especially as the Patriots defense was allowing 68 percent of red zone drives to end in touchdowns. Perez stressed the need for Trubisky to perform well quickly and to \"have his most accurate and efficient game of the season against the greatest quarterback he\\'ll ever face in his career.\" Although Stankevitz did not expect Chicago to win, losing \"wouldn\\'t dampen the positive vibes around the Bears, so long as they respond with wins against the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills in the next two weeks.\" Hicks, Gabriel, and safety Deon Bush were named the captains for the game.\\n\\nThe Patriots scored on the opening drive that saw Brady complete all but one of his passes and every rushing attempt go for at least five yards. After two punts, Parkey converted a 46-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Nick Kwiatkoski knocked the ball out of Cordarrelle Patterson\\'s hands and DeAndre Houston-Carson recovered the fumble. Five plays into the drive and on third down, Trubisky faced pressure that forced him to retreat horizontally across the field before advancing forward, running for the touchdown; while the score is officially an eight-yard touchdown run, Trubisky ran a distance of 71.91 yards on the play. A series later, Michel was pulled to the ground by Bilal Nichols and fumbled, with Nichols recovering the loose ball; Michel subsequently exited the game with a knee injury. Howard scored on a two-yard run to increase the Bears\\' advantage to ten points. However, the Patriots scored 14 unanswered points as Patterson returned the following kickoff 95 yards for a touchdown, followed by James White catching a five-yard touchdown pass from Brady to put New England up 21–17 at halftime. On the first drive of the second half, Trubisky led a drive that saw him run a 39 yards to the Patriots\\' one-yard line, where he eventually threw a six-yard touchdown to Cohen. Stephen Gostkowski kicked a 29-yard field goal, which was followed by Pat O\\'Donnell\\'s punt getting blocked by Dont\\'a Hightower and returned by Kyle Van Noy for a 29-yard return touchdown. During the third quarter, Trubisky was intercepted by J. C. Jackson, though the Patriots could not score. A quarter later, Jonathan Jones intercepted him again, which set up Brady\\'s two-yard touchdown throw to White. With about 6:30 left in the game and down by two touchdowns, Chicago attempted to fight back when Fuller intercepted Brady; Trubisky\\'s 11-yard touchdown to Burton narrowed the margin by seven. New England punted with 24 seconds remaining in the game. The Bears reached as far as their 45-yard line with one second left, where Trubisky threw a Hail Mary pass; although Kevin White caught the pass, he was tackled one yard short of the end zone to seal the 38–31 defeat.\\n\\nNow on a two-game losing streak that dropped them to 3–3, the Bears fell from first to third in the NFC, tied with the Lions. Trubisky\\'s 39-yard run to set up the Cohen touchdown was the longest by a Bear in 2018, while his team-leading 81 rushing yards were the most by a Bears quarterback since Cade McNown in 2000.\\n\\nWeek 8: vs. New York Jets\\n\\nThe New York Jets, who had not defeated the Bears since 2000 and won just three of eleven all-time meetings, visited Soldier Field in week eight. The Jets were led by rookie quarterback Sam Darnold and running back Isaiah Crowell, who was averaging 5.7 yards per carry. Entering the game, Darnold led the league in interceptions with ten and had lost much of his receiving corps to injury, a predicament that Stankevitz pointed out could be exploited by the Bears defense even with Mack out with ankle issues; the game was the first that Mack missed in his NFL career. For the Bears offense, Robinson did not play due to a nagging groin injury. As Trubisky struggled under pressure, Stankevitz expressed the need to protect him from Todd Bowles\\' blitzes; Trubisky\\'s 70.7 completion percentage dropped to 54.1 when blitzed. Nevertheless, Stankevitz predicted the Bears would record a \"comfortable win\" considering their advantages, especially with the help of playing at home. Cody Whitehair, Fuller, and Houston-Carson served as captains.\\n\\nThe Jets punted on the opening drive, followed by Parkey missing a 40-yard field goal wide right. After a second Jets punt, the Bears scored the first touchdown as Trubisky threw a screen to Cohen before the blitz could overwhelm him, enabling Cohen to run for the 70-yard touchdown. New York responded with Jason Myers\\' 42-yard kick in the second quarter, which was followed by punts on every possession for the rest of the first half. In the third quarter, Trubisky threw a four-yard touchdown to Miller, and Parkey added a 32-yard field goal to start the fourth quarter and put the Bears up by two touchdowns. The Jets answered with Darnold\\'s 16-yard touchdown to Chris Herndon, completing a 75-yard drive that was aided by Jackson\\'s unnecessary roughness penalty on third down and a 29-yard throw by Darnold to Deontay Burnett. Chicago retaliated with a 79-yard series that concluded with Howard\\'s two-yard touchdown run; Howard also recorded a 24-yard run on the drive, his longest of the year. Following two punts, time ran out during the Jets\\' final drive to close the game.\\n\\nAlthough the Bears defense recorded only one sack (by Callahan), it held the Jets\\' rushing game to just 2.4 yards per carry and 57 rushing yards. The Jets offense had just 98 total yards after three quarters, and ended with 201 (75 of which came in garbage time), the lowest allowed by the 2018 Bears to date. Leno said, \"We wanted to see what we could do after going down two games and we got a \\'W\\'. We\\'re just trying to build from that. We\\'re a tough resilient team and we\\'re just going to try to keep battling.\"\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter, Long and tight end Dion Sims were blocking for Howard when Sims landed on Long\\'s right foot. On November 3, the Bears placed Long on injured reserve and promoted Mizzell from the practice squad to take his place. It was Long\\'s third straight season plagued by long-term injury. In his place, Eric Kush and Witzmann split duties at right guard.\\n\\nWeek 9: at Buffalo Bills\\n\\nIn a rematch of the final preseason game, the Bears went to New Era Field to play the 2–6 Bills; it was the Bears\\' first game in Orchard Park, New York since a 33–27 loss in 2002, and although the Bears lost the latest meeting in 2014, they led the series 7–5. With starter Josh Allen and backup Derek Anderson out due to injuries, the Bills were forced to play third stringer Nathan Peterman at quarterback. In seven career appearances and three starts, Peterman struggled mightily as he had just three touchdown passes against nine interceptions, a 45.7 completion percentage, and a passer rating of 31.4. Buffalo\\'s offense was also unimpressive in 2018, failing to score a touchdown in its latest two games having just two in the last five; the Bills were the 13th NFL team since 1940 to have seven or fewer touchdowns in the first eight games of a season. Despite the Bills\\' offensive woes, Stankevitz noted the Bears should remain disciplined and avoid committing penalties or turnovers that would keep Buffalo in contention. The Bears defense entered the game having yet to allow a rushing touchdown in 2018. For Chicago\\'s offense, it faced a Bills defense that Stankevitz connected to the 2017 Bears\\' in terms of stinginess and ability to prevent major plays. As such, Stankevitz wrote the offense should not be aggressive or try to \"force anything\". Comparing the game to the previous week against the Jets, he concluded his preview by predicting a Bears win in which they played a \"disciplined, clean game without a string of glaring mistakes.\" Leno, Floyd, and O\\'Donnell were the Bears\\' captains for the game.\\n\\nThe first quarter saw no scores and every series end with a punt. In the following quarter, Chicago scored 28 unanswered points starting with Howard\\'s one-yard touchdown run. Over the Bills\\' next three possessions, the Bears recorded turnovers on each: Jackson stripped Jason Croom and returned the fumble 65 yards for a touchdown, followed by Adrian Amos intercepting a tipped pass, and Leonard Floyd doing the same and scoring on a 19-yard pick-six. Howard added an 18-yard touchdown run late in the first half to put the Bears up 28–0 at halftime. Both teams traded field goals to start the second half; after a Bills punt, Trubisky was intercepted by Tre\\'Davious White, though Buffalo could not capitalize and turned the ball over on downs. On the final play of the third quarter, Peterman was picked off by Fuller to set up Parkey\\'s 45-yard field goal. On the Bills\\' ensuing drive, Peterman saw two sacks nullified by 15-yard penalties on Lynch and Smith for unsportsmanlike conduct and facemasking, respectively. A defensive pass interference penalty on Amukamara in the end zone pushed Buffalo\\'s offense to Chicago\\'s one-yard line, where Peterman scored the first rushing touchdown on the Bears defense of 2018. After recovering Steven Hauschka\\'s onside kick, the Bears responded with Trubisky\\'s two-yard touchdown pass to Burton. The Bills reached the Bears\\' 31-yard line on their final drive before Peterman was sacked by Roy Robertson-Harris on fourth down. Daniel kneeled thrice to end the game.\\n\\nAs the Bears\\' fifth win of 2018, they tied their total from 2017. The 41–9 victory was the team\\'s largest road win since a 2012 41–3 win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. Nagy commented, \"Mentally, I thought our guys were strong all week and it showed on the field. They came ready to play and that was great in so many ways.\"\\n\\nA day later, the Bears signed former Vikings offensive lineman Willie Beavers. Most recently a member of the Seahawks, Beavers had visited the Bears along with Witzmann in early October.\\n\\nWeek 10: vs. Detroit Lions\\n\\nEntering their week ten matchup, the Bears–Lions rivalry was led by the former 97–74–5, though the 3–5 Lions had won nine of the last ten meetings. After missing the last two games with ankle issues, Mack returned to the team for the game, bolstering a defense that faced a Lions offense who traded away receiver Golden Tate and was slow in improving its rushing attack with rookie Kerryon Johnson. Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was also sacked ten times in the previous week\\'s game against the Vikings. For the Bears offense, which got Robinson back from his groin injury, they played a Lions defensive unit that was allowing 357.1 passing yards and 142.5 rushing yards per game. Detroit also lost cornerback Darius Slay to an injury. Stankevitz wrote the offense would capitalize on Slay missing the game and a strong defense to record \"a comfortable win.\" Callahan, Michael Burton, and Patrick Scales were team captains.\\n\\nThe Bears scored on the opening drive via Cohen\\'s three-yard touchdown run, though Parkey\\'s extra point hit the right upright. After the Lions punted, the Bears scored again as Trubisky led a 91-yard series that culminated on a 36-yard touchdown throw to Robinson. In the second quarter, Trubisky threw a 45-yard touchdown pass to Miller, but Parkey once again had his PAT knock the left upright. On Detroit\\'s next drive, Stafford was intercepted by Callahan to set up Trubisky\\'s four-yard touchdown run. The Lions scored their first points of the game late in the first half with Johnson\\'s one-yard run. Matt Prater kicked a 52-yard field goal on the first possession of the second half; when the Bears attempted to respond in kind with Parkey\\'s 41-yard field goal, his unusual kicking problems continued as the ball collided with the right upright again. Johnson lost a fumble to Amos on the next drive, but Parkey once again fell victim to the uprights as his 34-yard kick sailed into the right one for the third time. Three drives later, Trubisky threw a 26-yard touchdown to Robinson; instead of kicking the extra point, Chicago elected to try the two-point conversion, which succeeded on a Trubisky pass to Trey Burton. Early in the fourth quarter, Stafford\\'s deep pass was intercepted by Amukamara on the Bears\\' three-yard line, but the team was forced to punt. The Lions added two consecutive scores on Stafford\\'s five- and thirteen-yard touchdowns to Kenny Golladay and Johnson, though their two-point conversions failed to make the score 34–22. Cohen recovered the onside kick with 7:21 left in the game and the Bears drained the clock to 1:15 before punting. Detroit could not score as the game came to a close.\\n\\nWith the victory, the Bears broke a ten-game losing streak against divisional teams; the sixth win also surpassed their total from 2017. In their first game back, Robinson recorded six receptions for 133 yards and two touchdowns, while Mack had two sacks.\\n\\nRegarding his bizarre day, Parkey commented, \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve hit the posts four times in my whole life, and I\\'ve been kicking for almost 15 years. So it\\'s almost comical. I was just pointing the ball down the middle today, and every time I kicked it down the middle, it just kept fading to the right. The wind was pushing it a little bit on me, but I have to be better than that. That\\'s why I\\'m here.\" Nagy added the Bears had no intention of signing new kickers.\\n\\nWeek 11: vs. Minnesota Vikings\\n\\nDonning the orange jerseys, the Bears hosted the 5–3–1 Minnesota Vikings on Sunday Night Football in a battle for the NFC North lead. In their 114-game rivalry, the Vikings held the all-time lead 60–52–2 and had won the last three matchups. The Bears took on a Vikings offense featuring new quarterback Kirk Cousins, receivers Adam Thielen, who had at least 100 receiving yards in eight of the first nine games of 2018, and Stefon Diggs, who had at least 90 in four. In his pre-game strategy article for the week, Stankevitz wrote about recording key plays like takeaways and sacks to swing momentum in the Bears\\' favor. For the offense, it faced a Minnesota defense that was allowing 8.6 yards on third down; although the three teams that beat the Vikings struggled on third down against them, it was crucial to convert in such situations. Stankevitz also emphasized the need for the team on both sides to improve in the fourth quarter and to record a \"\\'statement game\\' in which they prove they\\'ve arrived against a good team, or at least a team generally thought to be good.\" On Saturday, the team activated Adam Shaheen from injured reserve in exchange for Sims, who suffered a concussion against the Bills and was absent since; in accordance with the moves, James Stone was removed from the practice squad. Trubisky, Mack, and Cunningham were the team captains for the game.\\n\\nAfter a Vikings punt, the Bears scored first on Parkey\\'s 33-yard field goal. The score was followed by two consecutive turnovers as Mack forced Vikings running back Dalvin Cook to fumble, followed by Trubisky\\'s pass for Gabriel being intercepted by Anthony Harris. Trubisky rebounded from the error by throwing an 18-yard touchdown pass to Miller, followed by completing the two-point conversion to Bellamy; the decision to go for two over the safer extra point was influenced by Nagy\\'s aggressive coaching style and his skepticism following Parkey\\'s performance against the Lions. Parkey added a 41-yard field goal to put the Bears up 14–0, while Cousins\\' pass was picked off by Amos with ten seconds remaining in the first half. Late in the second half, Trubisky was intercepted again by Harris to set up Dan Bailey\\'s 36-yard field goal. Cohen then lost a fumble to Jaleel Johnson that led to another 36-yarder by Bailey. With the margin narrowed to eight, it grew again when Jackson intercepted Cousins and returned the pick 27 yards for a touchdown; the Bears scored on the ensuing conversion via a Trubisky pass to Shaheen. Minnesota later scored on the next drive with Cousins\\' 13-yard touchdown to Aldrick Robinson, followed by a successful conversion on a throw to Thielen. With 2:48 left in the game, Parkey kicked his third field goal of the game, a 48-yard attempt. Two minutes later, Diggs caught a five-yard touchdown pass, but the Vikings failed to score on the conversion. Cunningham recovered the onside kick to secure the win.\\n\\nFollowing his poor game against Detroit, Parkey rebounded by converting all three of his field goals against Minnesota. \"For that to happen, what happened last week, and then for Cody to come back this week and be 3-for-3 in field goals, it\\'s just a testament to him, who he is as a person,\" Nagy commented. \"And then to see our team rally behind him, that\\'s a special moment there that we\\'ll all remember.\"\\n\\nDuring the fourth quarter, Trubisky was hit in the shoulder by Harrison Smith while sliding, leading to an unnecessary roughness penalty on Smith. For the remainder of the game, he attempted just one pass (an incomplete) as other plays were runs. Lynch and Shaheen also suffered concussions. The three missed the following week\\'s game against the Lions as a result of their injuries.\\n\\nWeek 12: at Detroit Lions\\nNFL on Thanksgiving Day\\n\\nApproximately 85 hours and three days after the Vikings game, a brief period dubbed a \"mini-bye\" by Nagy that only featured one practice and no film session, the Bears visited Ford Field to play the Lions for the second time in three weeks. Part of the NFL\\'s Thanksgiving Day tradition, it was the 17th meeting between the two on the holiday; the Bears were 17–15–2 in total games played on Thanksgiving. With Trubisky out due to his shoulder injury, Chicago started Daniel at quarterback, his first regular season start since 2014 and third of his career. Tyler Bray was promoted from the practice squad to back up Daniel, which led to Marcus Cooper being released to make room for him on the active roster. While the Lions lost Johnson and receiver Marvin Jones to injuries of their own, Slay returned to action for the game. Parkey, Robinson, and Amos were team captains.\\n\\nThe scoreless first quarter saw five drives that ended with a punt. On the first play of the second quarter, Burton was stripped by DeShawn Shead and Jarrad Davis recovered the fumble, which set up LeGarrette Blount\\'s four-yard touchdown run. Parkey later kicked a 40-yard field goal, followed by Daniel leading a 65-yard drive that culminated with his ten-yard touchdown pass to Mizzell with 40 seconds left in the first half. On the two-point conversion, Daniel\\'s pass to Robinson was out of reach, making the score 9–7 at halftime. After three punts to open the second half, Blount scored on another four-yard run to give the Lions the lead, which Daniel answered with an 82-yard possession that led to a 14-yard touchdown throw to Cohen. In the fourth quarter, Prater kicked a 20-yard field goal to tie the game at 16 apiece. The Bears punted again, but on the ensuing series, Jackson intercepted Stafford\\'s throw and returned it 41 yards for the go-ahead touchdown. The Lions moved down the field into the Bears\\' red zone, but Fuller picked off Stafford in the end zone with 1:11 left in the game. After three runs to exhaust the Lions\\' timeouts that led to a first down, Daniel kneeled to secure the game.\\n\\nWith the victory, the Bears enjoyed their first five-game win streak since 2012. It was also the first time since that year that Chicago swept Detroit, while the two wins against the Lions and one against the Vikings marked the longest winning streak against NFC North teams in six seasons. When talking about his team, Nagy said, \"There\\'s a challenge every week and they accepted my challenge of going 3-0 in 12 days against three division opponents.\"\\n\\nDaniel completed 27 of 37 passes for 230 yards, two touchdowns, and a 106.8 passer rating. \"You don\\'t know when these opportunities will come and you just have to make the most of them,\" he stated.\\n\\nTwo days after the game, the Bears re-signed Franklin III to the practice squad.\\n\\nWeek 13: at New York Giants\\n\\nTrubisky remained out for the week thirteen game against the 3–8 New York Giants; although the Bears led the series 33–23–2, they had lost the last two games on the road. With Daniel leading the offense again, Stankevitz stressed the importance of avoiding turnovers, especially as the Giants averaged 30.8 points per game in those that they record at least two takeaways, compared to just 16 points if they do not. Chicago\\'s defense was challenged by Giants receiver Odell Beckham Jr., who Vic Fangio remarked could only be contained by \"going to mass on Saturday night\", and running back Saquon Barkley, who Fangio described required all eleven players to stop. Nevertheless, quarterback Eli Manning struggled when pressured, being sacked 38 times and throwing four interceptions under such circumstances. Stankevitz added for the Bears to continue excelling and to \"be yourself\", especially as the team lost in Miami after a bye week, while they entered the Giants game after a nine-day break. Daniel, Kwiatkoski, Amukamara, and Michael Burton were team captains.\\n\\nOn the second play of the game, Daniel\\'s pass to Cohen was underthrown and intercepted by Alec Ogletree, who returned the pick eight yards for the touchdown. Later in the quarter, Daniel threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Shaheen to tie the game. A drive later, Fuller intercepted Manning\\'s pass for Beckham, but Daniel was picked off by Ogletree again on the next series. In the second quarter, the Bears placed Hicks in at fullback for a fourth-and-goal at the one-yard line, where he scored on a one-yard run; the play was called \"Freezer Left\" in tribute to William \"The Refrigerator\" Perry, the last Bears defensive lineman to score a rushing touchdown. On the final drive of the first half, Aldrick Rosas kicked a 57-yard field goal to make the score 14–10. The Giants opened the second half with Beckham throwing a 49-yard touchdown pass to Russell Shepard, followed by Manning\\'s one-yard touchdown throw to Beckham on fourth down. In the fourth quarter, Parkey kicked a 36-yard field goal to draw the margin to seven points. Two possessions later, the Bears got the ball back on their own two-yard line with 2:26 left in the game, but Gabriel lost a fumble to Sean Chandler. Rosas\\' 37-yard field goal placed New York up by ten again, which Parkey answered with a 21-yard kick with 1:13 remaining. Daniel Brown recovered the ensuing onside kick. Daniel led the offense to the Giants\\' one-yard line, where they scored the game-tying touchdown on a trick play as time expired: Daniel handed off the ball to Trey Burton, who lateraled to Cohen in a similar play to the Philly Special that Burton was involved in a year prior, followed by Cohen throwing the touchdown to Miller. In overtime, Rosas kicked a 44-yard field goal to put New York up, but Chicago could not answer as Daniel fumbled thrice before turning the ball over on downs.\\n\\n\"I absolutely love this team,\" Nagy stated after the game. \"I love where we\\'re at. This is life, man. How are you going to rebound back from it? Are you going to sulk or are you going to pick it back up, go practice, go play and learn? And that\\'s what we\\'re going to do.\"\\n\\nWeek 14: vs. Los Angeles Rams\\n\\nOn Sunday Night Football, the Bears hosted the NFC-leading 11–1 Los Angeles Rams. It was the first meeting between the two since the Rams\\' return to Los Angeles and the first in Chicago since a 23–6 Bears win in 2012; in 92 total games entering week fourteen, Chicago led 53–36–3. Chicago\\'s second-ranked defense entered the game against Los Angeles\\' second-ranked offense led by quarterback Jared Goff, who ranked fourth in passing yards (3,754), sixth in passing touchdowns (27), and fifth in passer rating (109.9). Rams running back Todd Gurley led the league in rushing yards with 1,175 yards and 15 touchdowns. As a whole, Los Angeles was averaging 34.9 points and 439.9 per game, scoring at least 23 points in every game in 2018 and breaking the 30-point mark in all but two. Considering the Rams\\' success offensively, Stankevitz emphasized discipline by the Bears defense to avoid mistakes like allowing large plays. With Trubisky back, the Bears\\' 20th-ranked offense faced a Rams defense that was ranked 18th in total defense and 19th in scoring, having allowed 30-point games on five occasions in 2018. In order to contain the Rams offense, Stankevitz wrote the Bears offense needed to maintain control of the ball and time of possession, minimizing the likelihood of a high-scoring battle and allowing the Chicago defense to rest. Rather than the usual three captains, the Bears had six for the Rams game: Hicks, Jackson, Leno, Mack, Robinson, and Trubisky.\\n\\nTrubisky\\'s first drive ended when he was intercepted by Marcus Peters. Greg Zuerlein kicked a 27-yard field goal to give the Rams the early lead, which the Bears answered with Parkey\\'s 39-yard kick. In the second quarter, Goff was intercepted by Smith to set up Parkey\\'s 31-yard field goal; after converting a fourth down situation on a fake punt, Zuerlein tied the game with his 50-yard kick. The first half ended with two interceptions as Trubisky was picked off by Nickell Robey-Coleman, followed by Jackson picking off Goff on the last play of the half. On the second play of the second half, Goldman sacked Goff in the end zone for a safety, a play that Trubisky said \"really set the tone for the second half.\" Chicago increased the lead on the ensuing drive on a trick play called \"Santa\\'s Sleigh\": Trubisky faked the hand-off to Hicks before throwing a two-yard touchdown pass to Bradley Sowell. After a punt by the Rams, Trubisky was intercepted by John Johnson, but Fuller responded on the next play by intercepting Goff\\'s pass, though the Bears eventually punted. In the fourth quarter, Zuerlein\\'s 40-yard kick hit the right upright; Los Angeles\\' next drive resulted in a turnover on downs when Goff was sacked by Hicks. Parkey eventually missed a 38-yard field goal wide left. On fourth down, Goff was picked off for the fourth time as Amukamara recorded the takeaway. After the Bears punted with 25 seconds remaining, Justin Davis ran for 19 yards to conclude the game.\\n\\nWith the victory, the Bears secured their first winning season since 2012. The game is the first in the Super Bowl era in which the lone touchdown was scored by an offensive lineman. Both quarterbacks struggled: Trubisky completed 16 of 30 passes for 110 yards and a touchdown, but also had three interceptions and a career-worst 33.3 passer rating; Goff\\'s four interceptions were the most in his career, while his 19.1 rating was also his lowest. Chicago\\'s defense also limited Gurley to just 28 yards on 11 carries, while the Rams\\' six points were the fewest scored since Sean McVay became the team\\'s head coach in 2017. It was the first game under McVay that the Rams failed to score a touchdown; McVay described the defeat as being \"very, very humbling\" for him. \"Our play on defense, for me all I can say is, wow,\" Nagy said. \"It was one that I haven\\'t seen in a long, long time against such a powerful opponent.\"\\n\\nDuring the game, Callahan broke his left foot and was placed on injured reserve. To take his roster spot, the Bears signed Marcus Williams, a former starter for the Jets who spent time with the Buccaneers in 2018.\\n\\nWeek 15: vs. Green Bay Packers\\n\\nThe Bears\\' second game against the Packers took place in week fifteen, this time at home; the Bears\\' last victory over their rivals at Soldier Field came in 2010, though the 5–7–1 Packers had yet to win an away game in 2018. Besides facing Rodgers, who entered the game with only one interception on the season, the Chicago defense was tasked with stopping running back Aaron Jones, who was averaging 5.6 yards per carry, including 6.5 yards in wins. To stop Jones, Stankevitz highlighted 4.5 yards per attempt as a critical number as the Seahawks, Vikings, and Cardinals each restricted Jones to below that average in the Packers\\' losses to them, while two of the Bears\\' losses came in which an opposing running back went over it. Stankevitz also emphasized the importance of not playing conservatively when ahead as the strategy led to the Bears\\' defeat in week one; he wrote, \"The Bears are a better team than the Packers, plain and simple. But until this franchise proves it can reliably beat Rodgers, who\\'s won 16 of his 20 regular season meetings with the Bears, these rivalry games shouldn\\'t be met with overconfidence.\" Howard, Fuller, and O\\'Donnell were the Bears\\' captains for the game.\\n\\nPunts wrapped up the first two drives of the game before Howard scored the first points on a nine-yard touchdown run. In the second quarter, Crosby kicked a 41-yard field goal, which the Bears answered on Trubisky\\'s 12-yard touchdown pass to Cohen, who beat safety Kentrell Brice to the end zone. Green Bay responded with 11 unanswered points to tie the game on Crosby\\'s 43-yard field goal and Jamaal Williams\\' ten-yard touchdown run that led to Rodgers\\' two-point conversion to Adams. Early in the fourth quarter, the Bears reached the Packers\\' 23-yard line before Cohen fumbled when he tried handing off the ball to Howard, with defensive end Dean Lowry recovering the loose ball. The Packers could not take advantage and eventually punted, followed by Trubisky throwing a 13-yard touchdown to Burton. After Parkey kicked a 24-yard field goal to put the Bears up by ten, Rodgers attempted to lead a drive into their red zone. On Chicago\\'s nine-yard line, Jackson intercepted Rodgers, but suffered an ankle injury on the play. Following a Bears punt, Crosby kicked a 45-yard field goal with ten seconds left, and Robinson recovered the onside kick to secure the victory.\\n\\nThe Bears clinched the NFC North with the win for the first time since 2010, while also eliminating the Packers from playoff contention. After the game, Amukamara said, \"The McCaskeys are probably so excited. They are going to have an even better Christmas. This was for the fans, this was for the organization, and we are glad that we were able to do it.\"\\n\\nWeek 16: at San Francisco 49ers\\n\\nIn week sixteen, the Bears played the 4–10 San Francisco 49ers in Levi\\'s Stadium. In 66 all-time games, the 49ers led the series 34–31–1, including winning the last game 15–14 in 2017, though the Bears won the latest away game 28–24 in 2014. The 49ers offense was led by rookie quarterback Nick Mullens, who completed 63 percent of his throws for 1,021 yards, five touchdowns, two interceptions, and a 101.4 passer rating in his last three games; he also had five touchdowns against one interception for a rating of 113.8 against blitzing defenses. Defensively, San Francisco was described by Stankevitz as not making \"lot of sense\", especially as it forced just two interceptions in 2018 but allowed fewer than four plays of at least 20 yards; Stankevitz compared this to the 2017 Bears\\' defense, which struggled to record interceptions but did not allow major-yardage plays. Stankevitz wrote a victory was crucial in proving the Bears\\' competitiveness on the road and keeping them in contention for a first-round bye. Shaheen, Irving, and Robertson-Harris served as team captains; Robertson-Harris and Irving are from the San Francisco Bay Area, with the latter also playing college football at San Jose State.\\n\\nA scoreless first quarter saw Parkey miss a 37-yard field goal (again) and punts on other drives. In the second quarter, 49ers kicker Robbie Gould scored on three consecutive drives with field goals of 33, 30, and 23 yards; the second kick capitalized on a botched Trubisky fumble that was recovered by DeForest Buckner. When the Bears were down 6–0, Trubisky was intercepted by K\\'Waun Williams in the end zone, but a holding penalty on Fred Warner nullified the turnover; Trubisky eventually threw a four-yard touchdown pass to Miller. After the 49ers punted to start the second half, Robinson lost a fumble to Marcell Harris until review overturned the play. The Bears offense drove 90 yards and Howard capped off the series with a two-yard touchdown run. In the fourth quarter, the 49ers reached the Bears\\' red zone before Mullens\\' pass for Marquise Goodwin bounced off his hands to Trevathan for the interception. On the following drive, Trubisky was hit by Harris after sliding near the Chicago sideline, sparking a brawl; Harris received a 15-yard penalty for the hit, while Bellamy, Miller, and 49ers cornerback Richard Sherman were ejected for their involvement in the fight. Later on the drive, Robinson had the ball punched from his hands by Tarvarius Moore and recovered by the 49ers\\' Greg Mabin. With 1:52 remaining in the game, the 49ers reached the Bears\\' 45-yard line before Mullens\\' pass for Goodwin on fourth down fell incomplete. Trubisky kneeled twice to end the game.\\n\\nThe victory guaranteed the Bears would receive the third seed at the least in the playoffs, though the second seed is a possibility provided they defeat the Vikings and the Rams lose to the 49ers in week seventeen. Amukamara stated after the game, \"Because we\\'ve been in this situation so many times and we\\'ve come up big, it\\'s almost expected of us. Like when we had to go back on the field to win it, everyone was poised. Nobody was shaken. We expected great things to come out of here.\"\\n\\nTrubisky completed 25 of 29 passes for 246 yards and a touchdown in the win for a completion percentage of 86.2, the highest by a Bears quarterback in a game with at least 20 passes since 1950. He also surpassed the 3,000 passing yards in a season mark, becoming the sixth quarterback in Bears history to accomplish the feat.\\n\\nWeek 17: at Minnesota Vikings\\n\\nIn the final week of the regular season, the Bears played their second game against the 8–6–1 Vikings, who required a win to qualify for the playoffs. In his keys article, Stanketvitz stressed the need to minimize turnovers, especially in Minnesota. For the Bears\\' defense, he wrote the unit especially had to stop the run against a Vikings offense that recorded 320 combined rushing yards in their last two victories under new offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski; Minnesota running back Dalvin Cook, who was limited to just 12 yards in week eleven, averaged over 100 yards and a touchdown in the two wins. 320 yards on the ground in wins over the Miami Dolphins and Detroit Lions. Stankevitz also noted Cousins struggled in a similar playoff-determining situation with the 2016 Washington Redskins, throwing two interceptions in a loss. Nevertheless, considering the importance of a win for the Vikings, Stankevitz predicted a Bears loss. The day before the game, Long was activated from IR and Bray was waived to allow roster space; Bray eventually returned to the practice squad, taking Beavers\\' place. Bush, Houston-Carson, and Sowell were team captains.\\n\\nThe Vikings punted on the opening drive, which the Bears followed by scoring on Howard\\'s six-yard touchdown run. After five consecutive series of punts, Howard scored again on a one-yard run, but Parkey missed the extra point. With 53 seconds remaining in the first half, Bailey kicked a 45-yard field goal to decrease the margin to ten points at halftime. Late in the third quarter, Diggs caught a two-yard touchdown pass from Cousins. The Bears responded with a 16-play drive that lasted a season-long 9:05 and saw the offense convert all four third-down situations; the possession culminated in Cohen\\'s three-yard touchdown run. On the ensuing conversion, running a play dubbed \"Lollipop\" that saw Amukamara sprint along the line of scrimmage before the snap, Trubisky completed a throw to Kwiatkoski for two points. Parkey later kicked a 42-yard field goal to put the Bears up by 14 points. The game\\'s final three drives resulted in turnovers on downs before Trubisky kneeled once to conclude the 24–10 win.\\n\\nWith the triumph, Chicago improved to 12–4, their best record since a 13–3 campaign in 2006. The win marked the Bears\\' first in Minnesota since 2011, while it was also the first season since that year in which they swept the Vikings. With the Rams defeating the 49ers, the Bears were locked into the third seed and a wild-card game. The victory also helped clinch a playoff spot for the Philadelphia Eagles, who ended the regular season 9–7 after defeating the Washington Redskins earlier in the day and needed a Chicago victory to pass the Vikings for the final playoff slot.\\n\\nStandings\\n\\nDivision\\n\\nConference\\n\\nPostseason\\n\\nNFC Wild Card Playoffs: vs. (6) Philadelphia Eagles\\n\\nThe Bears\\' first playoff game since the 2010 season saw them host the Super Bowl LII champion Eagles, led by backup quarterback and Super Bowl MVP Nick Foles. In the all-time series, the Bears led 30–14–1, but had lost the last three meetings; Chicago was also 1–2 in postseason games, with the latest game being a home defeat in 2001. Stankevitz projected the game to be determined at the line of scrimmage, especially with an Eagles defensive line featuring Fletcher Cox (10.5 sacks in 2018), Michael Bennett (9 sacks), and ends Chris Long and Brandon Graham (combined for 10.5). In contrast, the Bears\\' offensive line was ranked second by Pro Football Focus in pass blocking. For the Bears\\' defense, they faced a Philadelphia offensive line that allowed just one combined sack against star defenders like Aaron Donald, J. J. Watt, and Jadeveon Clowney. Stankevitz also wrote of the Chicago defense\\'s success in preventing long drives, especially at home, while Trubisky could overcome turnovers provided he was consistent. In predicting a Bears win, Stankevitz wrote, \"It would take an uncharacteristically-poor game for the Bears to lose on Sunday, and all week players and coaches have given off signs that they\\'re not merely happy to be in the playoffs.\" Following a team vote, Trubisky and Whitehair (offense), Hicks and Mack (defense), and Cohen and Cunningham (special teams) were named the team captains for the playoffs.\\n\\nJake Elliott kicked a 43-yard field goal on the opening drive. After three drives that resulted in punts, Foles was intercepted by Smith, which set up Parkey\\'s 36-yard field goal in the second quarter to tie the game. A drive later, Foles was picked off by Amos in the Bears\\' end zone, though the Bears were forced to punt on the resulting series. Parkey booted a 29-yard kick to end the first half with the 6–3 lead. In the third quarter, the Eagles were aided by two critical Bears penalties – a 15-yard unnecessary roughness on Amos and a 33-yard defensive pass interference on Amukamara – as Foles threw a ten-yard touchdown to Dallas Goedert. Early in the final period, Parkey\\'s 34-yard field goal narrowed the margin to one point, which was followed by Trubisky throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to Robinson on Chicago\\'s next possession. However, Gabriel was stopped on the two-point conversion. Following two punts, Philadelphia marched into Chicago\\'s territory; with 56 seconds remaining in the game and on fourth down from the Bears\\' two, Foles completed the score to Golden Tate to take the lead. Darren Sproles failed to score on the conversion to make the score 16–15 in Philadelphia\\'s favor. Cohen returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards to the Bears\\' 42, from which Trubisky led the offense as far as the Eagles\\' 25. After the Eagles used their final timeout with ten seconds left, Parkey\\'s potential game-winning 43-yard kick was partially tipped by Eagles tackle Treyvon Hester, which caused the ball to shift and hit the left upright and crossbar before bouncing into the end zone. Foles kneeled once to end the game.\\n\\n\"It\\'s one of the worst feelings in the world to let your team down,\" Parkey said after the game. \"I feel terrible. Continue to put things into perspective, continue to just put my best foot forward and just sleep at night knowing that I did everything in my power this week to make that kick and for whatever reason it hit the crossbar and the upright.\"\\n\\nEnd of season\\nFollowing the playoff exit, the Bears ended the season with a 12–5 record. After going 5–11 in 2017, the improvement in 2018 marked the team\\'s best single-season turnaround since going from five to 13 wins in 2001. The 12 wins under Nagy were the most by a new head coach in Bears history and the best rookie campaign among the 32 active coaches at the time, surpassing McVay and John Harbaugh (Baltimore Ravens) who had 11 in their first seasons.\\n\\nDespite failing to advance past the first round, fans and media lauded the team\\'s entertainment value in its trick plays, defensive touchdowns, and off-field activities. The NFL loosened rules regarding group celebrations in 2017, which allowed for teams like the Bears to perform elaborate gestures to celebrate turnovers and scores. Celebrations that particularly garnered attention included Jackson conducting a symphony after his Week 11 touchdown and Amukamara and the defense emulating the Detroit Motown music scene following Fuller\\'s game-winning interception in Week 12. To celebrate wins, with inspiration from the Chicago Cubs, the team began holding a dance party called \"Club Dub\" that included lights and a disco ball; \"dub\" is a slang term for \"win\". The rap song \"Swag Surfin\\'\" by Fast Life Yungstaz also became an unofficial anthem of Club Dub. Nagy\\'s post-victory speeches were highlighted by him saying the word \"Boom!\" while driving his arm into the ground like a football spike, and the action developed into an informal rallying cry for the team. Trubisky explained such moments made the \"experience so much better. It\\'s become something very special for this team.\"\\n\\nStatistics\\nUnder Nagy, the Bears offense recorded 421 total points in 2018, the ninth-most in the league. The passing game\\'s 28 combined touchdowns between Trubisky and Daniel ranked 17th, while the 17 rushing touchdowns were the tenth-highest.\\n\\nThe defense, whose authority was fully relinquished to Fangio after Nagy took over as head coach, was among the highest-rated in the NFL; the unit led the league in multiple categories like average points allowed per game (17.7), turnovers forced (36), interceptions (27), interceptions returned for touchdowns (5), opposing passer rating (72.9), and rushing yards allowed per game (80.0). With the defense\\'s success, Fangio was hired as the Denver Broncos head coach in 2019.\\n\\nAwards\\nFive players received weekly honors on six occasions during the regular season. In week four against the Buccaneers, Trevathan recorded two sacks, eight tackles, and a forced fumble to be named NFC Defensive Player of the Week, while Trubisky\\'s six-touchdown game earned him FedEx Air Player of the Week. Six weeks later against the Lions, Trubisky completed 23 of 30 passes for 355 yards, three touchdowns (along with one rushing), no interceptions, a career-best 76.7 completion percentage, and a 148.6 rating (the second-highest of the season behind the Buccaneers game) to win FedEx Air Player of the Week and NFC Offensive Player of the Week. Parkey\\'s week eleven performance versus Minnesota earned him NFC Special Teams Player of the Week, while Jackson\\'s game-winning pick-six in Detroit the following week granted him Defensive Player of the Week. In the season finale in Minnesota, Howard recorded a season-best 109 rushing yards, including a season-long 42-yard run on his first carry, and two touchdowns to win FedEx Ground Player of the Week.\\n\\nIn September and November, Mack and Jackson were named NFC Defensive Player of the Month, respectively. It was Mack\\'s second career DPOM honor since he won the AFC\\'s in November 2016 as he had a strip-sack in each of September\\'s four games, becoming the first player to record such a stat in four straight games since Robert Mathis of the 2005 Indianapolis Colts. He was also the first Bear to receive the accolade since Charles Tillman in October 2012 and the seventh in team history.  During November, Jackson recorded 15 tackles, two interceptions, a forced fumble and recover, and three defensive touchdowns.\\n\\nAfter no Bears made the Pro Bowl for the 2017 season, five were named to the 2019 Pro Bowl in December 2018. While no offensive players were elected originally, Cohen was voted as a kick returner; Mack, Hicks, Fuller, and Jackson were voted in on defense. Trubisky, Trey Burton, Floyd, Leno, Smith, Trevathan, and Whitehair were designated as alternates for the game. Following the Rams\\' NFC Championship Game win to advance to Super Bowl LIII, Trubisky formally replaced Jared Goff on the Pro Bowl roster, making him the first Bears quarterback to play in the all-star game since Jim McMahon in 1986. Leno and Whitehair later joined their teammates to increase the Bears Pro Bowler count to eight, their most since 2006.\\n\\nOn January 4, 2019, a league-high four Bears were named to the All-Pro team: Cohen, Fuller, Jackson, and Mack were all on the first team. It was the first All-Pro honor for Cohen (who was named as a punt returner), Fuller, and Jackson, while Mack received his third. For the team, it was Chicago\\'s first All-Pro since Long was named second-team in 2014, while their last first-team nominations were Tillman and Brandon Marshall in 2012; it was also the Bears\\' first four-player All-Pro effort since 2006 with Brian Urlacher, Devin Hester, Olin Kreutz, and Robbie Gould. The Pro Football Writers Association also the four to their All-NFL team.\\n\\nNagy and Fangio were named Coach of the Year and Assistant Coach of the Year, respectively, by two agencies: the PFWA on January 17, and the Associated Press at the 8th Annual NFL Honors on February 2. On March 25, Ryan Pace was named Executive of the Year by the Sporting News, becoming the third Bears general manager to win the award after George Halas in 1956 and Michael McCaskey in 1985.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n \\n\\nChicago\\nChicago Bears seasons\\nChicago Bears\\n2010s in Chicago\\nBears\\nNFC North championship seasons', 'In the 2011 Los Angeles Dodgers season, the team was attempting to rebound from its fourth-place National League West finish in 2010. This was the franchise\\'s 54th season in Southern California, since moving from Brooklyn after the 1957 season. The Dodgers struggled in the 1st half of the season but wound up finishing with a winning record thanks to playing good baseball in August and September. They still finished the season in third place. Some positives included pitcher Clayton Kershaw winning the NL Pitching Triple Crown and Cy Young Award, and Outfielder Matt Kemp leading the league in Home Runs and RBI and finishing second for the NL MVP.\\n\\nOffseason\\n\\nManagerial change\\n\\nAfter three seasons with the Dodgers, Joe Torre chose to step down and turn the managerial reins over to his hitting coach Don Mattingly for the 2011 season. Torre\\'s 2,326th and final win was the last game of the 2010 season. Mattingly\\'s managerial career actually began in the fall of 2010 when he managed the Phoenix Desert Dogs of the Arizona Fall League, a team that several Dodger prospects were playing for.\\n\\nFront office/Coaching staff\\nOn October 7, 2010, the Dodgers announced that they were severing ties with club president Dennis Mannion, who had overseen all club operations for the past year. Owner Frank McCourt would take on a more \"direct and active\" role with the club.\\n\\nOn November 22, 2010, the Dodgers announced their coaching staff for the 2011 season. Returning from Joe Torre\\'s staff were pitching coach Rick Honeycutt and bullpen coach Ken Howell. Jeff Pentland, who had been a secondary hitting coach, was promoted to hitting coach. New staff members included bench coach Trey Hillman, secondary hitting instructor Dave Hansen, first base coach Davey Lopes and third base coach Tim Wallach.\\n\\nDodgers ownership was thrown into question on December 7, when the Judge in Frank McCourt\\'s divorce case against Jamie McCourt invalidated an agreement that would have given McCourt sole ownership of the Dodgers. McCourt vowed to try some other legal options to keep himself as sole owner of the team.\\n\\nThe Dodgers front office lost a key person when vice-president and assistant general manager Kim Ng accepted a position as senior VP for Baseball Operations with Major League Baseball.\\n\\nDeparting players\\nVeteran catcher Brad Ausmus retired at the end of the 2010 season. At the conclusion of the 2010 season, Rod Barajas, Hiroki Kuroda, Vicente Padilla, Jay Gibbons, Reed Johnson and Jeff Weaver all became free agents. Scott Podsednik also became a free agent, after declining his part of a mutual option, on November 4. On December 2, the Dodgers chose not to tender a contract to former All-Star, Catcher Russell Martin, making him a free agent. General Manager Ned Colletti described this decision as, \"one of the toughest decisions I\\'ve had to make, maybe ever.\" Due to Martin\\'s decreased production the past two seasons and his uncertain recovery from season ending surgery in 2010, the Dodgers felt he was not worth the salary increase he would have received in arbitration. They also released relief pitcher George Sherrill and outfielder Trent Oeltjen. To clear spots on their 40-man roster, the Dodgers traded infielder Chin-lung Hu to the New York Mets for minor league pitcher Michael Antonini and designated reliever Brent Leach for assignment so that he could sign with the Yokohama BayStars of the Japanese Leagues.\\n\\nPlayer signings/trades\\n\\nOn October 19, the Dodgers announced that they had re-signed starting pitcher Ted Lilly to a three-year contract. On November 4, Jay Gibbons re-signed with the Dodgers for one-year. On November 15, the Dodgers re-signed starting pitcher Hiroki Kuroda to a one-year, $12 million, contract. On November 19, the Dodgers signed minor league catcher Héctor Giménez and added him to their 40-man roster. On November 26, the Dodgers completed their rebuilding of the starting rotation by signing veteran pitcher Jon Garland. On November 30, the Dodgers signed veteran infielder Juan Uribe to a three-year contract, intending to make him the new second baseman. Soon afterward, the Dodgers traded incumbent second baseman Ryan Theriot to the St. Louis Cardinals for relief pitcher Blake Hawksworth. On December 3, one day after releasing veteran Russell Martin, the Dodgers re-signed Catcher Rod Barajas to a one-year deal. Soon afterward, on December 9, the Dodgers finalized a deal to bring back pitcher Vicente Padilla with a one-year contract. Padilla was slated to compete with Garland for the fifth starter spot, and also to possibly pitch out of the bullpen. On December 11, the Dodgers signed outfielder Tony Gwynn, Jr. to a one-year deal. On December 14, the Dodgers signed catcher Dioner Navarro to a contract, to compete with Barajas and A. J. Ellis for time behind the plate. The Dodgers added to the relief corps on December 16 by signing right-handed pitcher Matt Guerrier to a three-year contract. The Dodgers signed outfielder Marcus Thames on January 18.\\n\\nSpring training\\nSpring training for the 2011 season officially got under way on February 16, 2011, when the pitchers and catchers reported to Camelback Ranch. One pitcher who did not report, however, was reliever Ronald Belisario. For the third season in a row, Belisario missed his reporting date due to visa problems in his home country. Belisario remained stuck in Venezuela indefinitely, missing the entire season. The Dodgers also made news on the first day of camp by naming Clayton Kershaw as the opening day starting pitcher. The Dodgers pitching depth took a major hit when Vicente Padilla underwent surgery to repair a radial nerve injury and Jon Garland suffered a strained oblique muscle. The spring training injury problems continued with both third baseman Casey Blake and catcher Dioner Navarro suffering injuries that would keep them off the opening day roster.\\n\\nRegular season\\n\\nOff the field\\n\\nOn April 20, Baseball commissioner Bud Selig announced that Major League Baseball would appoint a representative to take over all business and day-to-day operations of the Dodgers. The move was likely instigated by media reports that owner Frank McCourt had to arrange a $30 million loan from Fox to cover the teams payroll as well as uncertainty over the teams ownership situation relating to the ongoing divorce litigation. On April 25, Selig appointed former Texas Rangers president Tom Schieffer to be the man in charge of the Dodgers situation.\\n\\nIn June, Frank and Jamie McCourt reached an out-of-court settlement of their divorce case, which was contingent on MLB\\'s approval of the proposed television contract between the Dodgers and FOX, which would have included an ownership stake in Fox Sports Prime Ticket. However, on June 20, Commissioner Selig announced that he was rejecting the proposed deal on the grounds that it was not in the best interests of the Dodgers.\\n\\nWith speculation circulating that McCourt would be unable to meet the payroll at the end of June and that he might then lose the team, on June 27, the Dodgers filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection.\\n\\nSeason standings\\n\\nNational League West\\n\\nRecord vs. opponents\\n\\nOpening Day starters\\n\\nMarch/April\\nThe Dodgers began the season on March 31 against the San Francisco Giants at Dodger Stadium. Starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw outpitched Giants ace Tim Lincecum, striking out nine batters in seven shutout innings, as the Dodgers won 2–1. After the game, a Giants fan was seriously injured after he was assaulted in the Dodger Stadium parking lot. The incident would provoke increased security at future home games as well as a joint fundraiser by the two teams in support of the man\\'s family. Back on the field, the Dodgers took the second game of the series also, as some aggressive baserunning by Matt Kemp and two Giants errors were just enough offense to back a solid start by Chad Billingsley in the 4–3 win. Matt Cain and three relievers combined to shut out the Dodgers 10–0 the following day, as Ted Lilly and Kenley Jansen each gave up four runs in the loss. A big seventh inning, including an RBI triple by Marcus Thames helped Hiroki Kuroda and the Dodgers take the series with a 7–5 victory in the finale.\\n\\nThe Dodgers began their first roadtrip of the season in Colorado for a two-game series with the Rockies. Troy Tulowitzki hit a home run to key the Rockies 3–0 win in the opener and Billingsley struggled in the second game as the Rockies won 7–5. Tony Gwynn, Jr. singled home the winning run in the bottom of the 11th as the Dodgers beat his former team, the San Diego Padres 4–2 to start their next series. The game had been suspended due to rain in the top of the ninth and was not finished till the following day. Kuroda pitched 8 2/3 scoreless innings in the second game of the series as the Dodgers won 4–0. John Ely made a spot start for the Dodgers on April 10 against the Padres, allowing two home runs while the Dodgers offense could only tally four singles in a 7–2 loss. Kershaw continued his dominance over the Giants in his next start, blanking them for 6 2/3 innings while the Dodgers opened a series in San Francisco with a 6–1 victory. The victory came with a cost, however, as starting shortstop and leadoff hitter Rafael Furcal suffered a broken thumb while stealing third base. He was placed on the disabled list and the team announced that he would need four to six weeks for total recovery. The Dodgers blew a three-run lead in the second game of the series, losing 5–4. Two solo homers by Pablo Sandoval and Mike Fontenot in the sixth inning off Ted Lilly led to a 4–3 defeat in the series finale.\\n\\nThe Dodgers returned home on April 14 to begin a four-game series against the St. Louis Cardinals. Kuroda struggled with his control in the opener as the Dodgers lost 9–5. Jon Garland made his first start of the season the next day, but he was wild and the Dodgers were pounded 11–2. Clayton Kershaw had his first poor outing of the season in game 3 of the series, as the Dodgers lost 9–2 to extend their losing streak to five games. The Dodgers snapped that streak the following day as Billingsley pitched eight shut out innings, while striking out eleven. Matt Kemp hit a walk-off two-run home run in the bottom of the ninth for the 2–1 win. The Dodgers then began a four-game homestand with the Atlanta Braves. Prior to the first game, the Dodgers called up their 2010 minor league player of the year, Jerry Sands, who doubled in his first at-bat and later picked up his first RBI to back solid pitching from Ted Lilly in the Dodgers 2–1 win. Brandon Beachy outpitched Kuroda in the next game, as the Braves broke open a tight game with an eight-run ninth inning to pull off a 10–1 rout. Jon Garland bounced back from his rough debut to pick up the complete-game victory, as Andre Ethier had three hits including a home run and Juan Uribe had four RBI in the Dodgers 6–1 victory. Matt Kemp hit a two-run walk-off home run in the 12th inning as the Dodgers beat the Braves 5–3 to end the series.\\n\\nOn April 22 the Dodgers opened a six-game road trip by beating the Chicago Cubs 12–2. The next day, the Cubs scored five runs off Matt Guerrier in the bottom of the eighth to come from behind to beat the Dodgers 10–8. In the game, Andre Ethier extended his hitting streak to 20 games. The Dodgers scored five runs in the first inning to back Kuroda\\'s solid 6 2/3 innings pitched as they won the series finale 7–3 over the Cubs. The Dodgers next traveled to Florida to take on the Marlins. They lost the opener after a ninth-inning fielding error by shortstop Jamey Carroll allowed the tying run to score in the ninth inning. A batter later, Omar Infante singled in the winning run off Jonathan Broxton and the Marlins came from behind to win 5–4. On April 26, Ethier extended his hitting streak to 23 games, setting an MLB April record but the Dodgers offense struggled and the team lost to the Marlins 4–2. The Dodgers won the last game of the series 5–4 on an Andre Ethier home run in the 10th inning. Vicente Padilla pitched the bottom of the 10th, for his first save since 2000.\\n\\nThe Dodgers returned home on April 29 to begin a three-game series against the Padres. In the opener, solo homers by Uribe and Kemp and a game saving diving catch by Tony Gwynn, Jr. helped the Dodgers pick up a 3–2 with. The Dodgers lost 5–2 the next day as wild pitch by Matt Guerrier and an error by Dioner Navarro let three costly runs score in the 8th to break the tie.\\n\\nMay\\nAfter playing .500 ball in April, the Dodgers were shut out by the Padres to start the month of May 7–0. The Dodgers opened a series with the Cubs on May 2 with a 5–2 victory as doubles by Uribe, Barajas and Sands led the Dodgers offense in support of starter Clayton Kershaw. Two walks in the ninth inning by Jonathan Broxton doomed the Dodgers the following day as they lost 4–1, despite seven strong innings from starter Chad Billingsley, who only allowed one run. Andre Ethier extended his hitting streak to 29 games, and tied Zack Wheat for second place on the Dodgers franchise list. The Dodgers dropped the final game of the homestand 5–1 to the Cubs as Ethier sat out the game due to a sore elbow.\\n\\nThe Dodgers dropped their third straight on the opener of a road series against the New York Mets, 6–3 as Jason Pridie hit a three-run homer off Kuorda with two outs in the sixth inning. Ethier\\'s hitting streak finally ended on May 7, when he went 0 for 4 against the Mets. He finished with a 30-game hitting streak, second most in Dodgers history behind the 31 game streak by Willie Davis in 1969. The game was doubly disappointing as the Dodgers losing streak hit 4 with a 4–2 loss. Clayton Kershaw pitched 6 2/3 strong innings and Andre Ethier hit a two-run homer to end the losing streak with a 4–2 win. The Dodgers road woes continued on May 9, when Manager Don Mattingly and third baseman Juan Uribe were both ejected after a bad umpire call in the eighth and the Pirates scored three runs in the next half inning to beat the Dodgers 4–1. The Dodgers picked up a big win the next day as Matt Kemp broke open a scoreless tie with a three-run homer in the sixth inning and the Dodgers offense took off for a 10–3 win. The Dodgers took the lead in the series on May 11 as they shut out the Pirates 2–0 thanks to an excellent start by Hiroki Kuroda, who struck out eight in seven innings. The Dodgers finale against the Pirates was called off due to rain after two innings with the Dodgers leading 1–0. The game would eventually be made up on September 1.\\n\\nThe team returned home on May 13 to take on the Arizona Diamondbacks. Clayton Kershaw struck out 11 and the bullpen survived a shaky ninth inning to hold on for a 4–3 win. The next day, Chad Billingsley allowed only hit and one unearned run in eight innings but the Dodgers still lost 1–0 as the offense was completely shut down. The Dodgers offense continued to sputter on May 15, as Ian Kennedy held them to one run in six innings and the Dodgers lost 4–1. The Milwaukee Brewers came to town for a brief two game series and took the opener from the Dodgers 2–1 as Carlos Gómez robbed Uribe of a home run and Shaun Marcum stifled the Dodgers offense. The Dodgers finally won a game on May 18 as Kuroda and two relievers shut down the Brewers and Matt Kemp\\'s two-run homer in the first provided just enough offense for a 3–0 victory. The San Francisco Giants came to town on May 19 and beat the Dodgers on a three-run home run by Cody Ross in the ninth inning for an 8–5 win. The Dodgers disappointing homestand came to a close when they failed to cash in a bases-loaded situation in the bottom of the ninth and fell 3–1 to the Giants. Nate Schierholtz robbed Jamey Carroll of a potential game-winning hit to clinch the game.\\n\\nThe Dodgers opened interleague play with a 6–4 10 inning victory over the Chicago White Sox. However, the next day Jon Garland got lit up for seven runs in 3 2/3 innings as the Dodgers lost 9–2. The White Sox put another hurt on the Dodgers the next day, 8–3 as both Ethier and Barajas left the game with injuries. On May 24, Kenley Jansen unraveled in the ninth inning, allowing three runs with two outs to blow a save 4–3 to the Houston Astros.\\nJerry Sands hit his first career grand slam home run on May 25 to lift the Dodgers to a 5–4 victory. The Dodgers lost the final game of the series as J. R. Towles hit a walk-off single off Matt Guerrier in the ninth inning.\\n\\nThe Dodgers returned home on May 28 and pinch hitter Dioner Navarro hit a bases-loaded line drive single with no outs in the bottom of the ninth o lift the Dodgers to a 3–2 victory and allow rookie Rubby De La Rosa to pick up his first career victory. The Dodgers offense went back into hibernation mode on the 29th as the Marlins picked up a 6–1 victory. he Dodgers picked up their first series win in more than a month on the 29th, thanks to a dominant performance from Clayton Kershaw. He pitched his second complete-game shutout of his career, recording 10 strikeouts and also picking up two hits, the same amount the Marlins managed in the game. The Dodgers offense also came alive, for an 8–0 victory.\\nThe offense continued against the Rockies on May 30, when James Loney hit a home run and Ethier was 2 for 4 with 3 RBI in the 7–1 win. Matt Kemp and Casey Blake both homered in the Dodgers 8–2 win as the team closed out the month of May with a three-game winning streak, where the offense has been unusually productive.\\n\\nJune\\n\\nThe Dodgers brief winning streak came to an end as they were shut out by Ubaldo Jiménez 3–0 to begin June.\\n\\nThe Dodgers offense apparently didn\\'t make the road trip to Cincinnati to play the Reds on June 3, losing 2–1. The Dodgers erased a five-run deficit in the eighth inning on June 4 and won 11–8 in extra innings. Matt Kemp hit two home runs, including the game tying grand slam in the win. The Dodgers concluded their series with the Reds with a 9–6 win on June 5 as Chad Billingsley picked up the win and also homered and contributed a career-high three RBIs. Cliff Lee out pitched Ted Lilly on June 6, striking out 10 in seven innings in the Phillies 3–1 win over the Dodgers. Rookie Rubby De La Rosa made his first Major League start on July 7, allowing one run in five innings, fellow rookie Dee Gordon, had hits in his first three career at-bats and Matt Kemp added the insurance runs with a two-run home run as the Dodgers won 6–2.  Cole Hamels shut down the Dodgers the next day as the Phillies held on for a 2–0 win. Matt Kemp finished a single away from the cycle, but the Dodgers pitching melted down, allowing five runs in the seventh inning to blow a five-run lead and lose 9–7 to the Colorado Rockies on June 9. Kemp didn\\'t start the following day, but came off the bench to hit his league leading 19th homer to spark a five-run rally in the ninth, but the Dodgers still fell a bit short, losing to the Rockies 6–5. On June 11, Aaron Miles and Jamey Carroll combined to go 8 for 9 and Casey Blake had a three-run pinch double to spark the offense but it was spectacular defensive plays by Dee Gordon and Tony Gwynn, Jr. that saved the game for a shaky bullpen as the Dodgers won 11–7. The Dodgers got the best of Ubaldo Jiménez in their second meeting with him, as James Loney hit a grand slam and Matt Kemp and Rod Barajas added solo blasts in the 10–8 win.\\n\\nThe Dodgers returned home to play the Reds, dropping the opener 6–4 when Dee Gordon committed a costly error in the seventh inning with the game tied, leading to four runs scoring. The Dodgers wasted a fine start by Kershaw on June 15 as the Scott Elbert allowed a go-ahead eighth-inning single to Joey Votto and the Reds won 3–2. Scott Rolen got three hits and drove in three runs as the Reds finished off their sweep of the Dodgers 7–2. The slumping Dodgers were subsequently handled by Houston starter Brett Myers, who retired 17 consecutive batters at one point and made only 98 pitches in a 7–3 Astros win. The Dodgers home losing streak hit five when they were shut out by the Astros 7–0 on June 18. The game was doubly frustrating because starting catcher Rod Barajas suffered an ankle strain in the second inning and joined the multitude of Dodgers already on the disabled list. Manager Don Mattingly said after the game, \"We\\'re frustrated, that\\'s for sure, but you know what? We don\\'t have time to be frustrated\\xa0... This is not the time to feel sorry for ourselves.\" The Dodgers avoided being swept by the last place Astros with a 1–0 victory on June 19, that ended the five-game losing streak. A solo homer by Dioner Navarro in the bottom of the 8th inning was all the Dodgers offense could muster, but it was enough as Hiroki Kuroda and two relievers pitched a shutout. In the next game, Clayton Kershaw was dominant, striking out 11 in a two-hit shutout of the Detroit Tigers. He also hit a two-run eighth-inning single to extended the Dodgers lead in the 4–0 win. Chad Billingsley\\'s turn was next and he also pitched effectively, allowing just one run in 5 1/3 innings as the Dodgers won their third straight, 6–1, over the Tigers. Matt Kemp reached base all five times he came up to bat in the series finale, with three hits (including a triple) and two walks but the Dodgers were done in by four home runs hit by the Tigers off of Ted Lilly in the 7–5 loss. The Los Angeles Angels came to town next for the next installment of the Freeway Series. In the opener, the Angels won a sloppy game with baserunning and fielding errors 8–3. \"I don\\'t like the way it\\'s going, thats for sure.\" Manager Don Mattingly said after the Dodgers lost 6–1 in game 2. The Dodgers bounced back to take the series finale 3–2. Clayton Kershaw struck out eleven in the game and pitched his second straight complete game, the first Dodger to do so in 11 years. Tony Gwynn, Jr.\\'s RBI single in the bottom of the ninth won it for the Dodgers.\\n\\nThe Dodgers next continued interleague play with a road trip to play the Minnesota Twins. The Dodgers had a season-high 24 hits and 15 runs as they shut out the Twins. The game was the largest margin of victory for the Dodgers since September 2, 2002, and the largest shutout since June 28, 1969. Every member of the Dodgers\\' starting lineup had at least one hit, one run and one RBI for the first time in LA Dodger history. The Dodgers couldn\\'t keep the momentum going as Ted Lilly struggled in the next game, and they lost 6–4 to the Twins. The Dodgers finished the month of June by dropping a close one to the Twins, 1–0. Rubby De La Rosa pitched a career-high seven innings, allowing just the one run on six hits, but it was not enough as the Dodgers offense went back into hibernation. The team finished the month ten games under .500 and fell into last place in the National League Western division. Matt Kemp summed up the team\\'s attitude, \"We have a lot of time left, we\\'re going to keep playing, keep battling, and we\\'re going to try our best to turn this thing around. We\\'ve got faith in ourselves.\"\\n\\nJuly\\nThe Dodgers started the month of July with a 5–0 road win against the Angels. Hiroki Kuroda pitched seven scoreless innings, while allowing only three hits for his first win since mid-May.Clayton Kershaw struck out ten batters on July 2 but was also charged with a season-high seven runs, while Jered Weaver shut down the Dodgers for a 7–1 Angel win. Chad Billingsley pitched a complete game in the final interleague game against the Angels, but a Russell Branyan home run in the seventh inning cost him the game, as the Angels beat the Dodgers 3–1.\\n\\nOne positive for the Dodgers amidst their increasingly forlorn season was when Matt Kemp and Clayton Kershaw were selected to represent the team at the All-Star Game. It would be the first all-star appearances for both of them. Andre Ethier was a Final Vote candidate but finished second to Shane Victorino of the Philadelphia Phillies. However, Victorino was injured and unable to participate so Ethier was selected to replace him on the All-Star roster, his second consecutive All-Star selection.\\n\\nThe Dodgers returned home for a Fourth of July matchup with the New York Mets. The game was only the Dodgers second sellout of the season and for five innings Rubby De La Rosa offered hope, as he was working on a no-hitter. However, he gave up three doubles in the sixth and the Dodgers found themselves on the wrong end of  a 5–2 contest. The Dodgers offense continued to sputter the next day as they left 13 men on base in a 6–0 shut out loss to the Mets. The Dodgers lost their fifth straight game, when the Mets beat them 5–3 on July 6. \"Right now it\\'s a little embarrassing because our team is better than last place...\" Matt Kemp said to reporters after the game, \"I think we\\'re all disappointed in ourselves at this moment, but we need to just not make excuses, keep playing the game and turn this thing around.\" Another terrific pitching performance by Clayton Kershaw snapped the losing streak. He pitched eight shutout innings, while striking out nine in the 6–0 victory. Kershaw became the first Dodger pitcher with nine or more strikeouts in four consecutive starts since Hideo Nomo in 1996 Chad Billingsley matched Kershaw with eight shutout innings on July 8, Rafael Furcal came up with his first RBI since May 29 in the bottom of the eighth and rookie closer Javy Guerra escaped a bases-loaded situation in the ninth as the Dodgers won their second straight shutout, 1–0, against the San Diego Padres. The next day was another pitching duel. Aaron Harang  and Rubby De La Rosa both pitched great games, De La Rosa only allowed one hit in his six innings of work and Harang was working on a no-hitter when he was taken out of the game after six. The Dodgers did not record a hit in the game until Juan Uribe doubled with two outs in the bottom of the ninth off Luke Gregerson. Dioner Navarro then singled him home for the winning run in the Dodgers second straight 1–0 victory over the Padres and their third straight shut out win. Andre Ethier hit two home runs on July 10, to lead the Dodgers to a 4–1 victory, their first series sweep of the season and first four-game winning streak of the season. They climbed out of last place and headed into the all-star break with a  41–51 record.\\n\\nDuring the all-star break, the Dodgers made a trade.. acquiring outfielder Juan Rivera from the Toronto Blue Jays for future considerations. To make room on the roster, they designated often-injured Marcus Thames for assignment. \"Juan will be the right-handed counterpart to Tony Gwynn Jr. in left field, and he can fill in at first base\", said general manager Ned Colletti. Matt Kemp competed in the Home Run Derby during the All-Star break, but only managed to hit two home runs and did not advance past the first round. Kemp\\'s comment on his performance was, \"It\\'s harder than it looks.\" The National League won the All-Star game 5–1. Kemp reached base twice with a walk and a single, Ethier singled in his only at-bat and Kershaw pitched a scoreless inning on only eight pitches.\\n\\nThe Dodgers began the second half of the season where they left off, extending their winning streak to five with a 6–4 road victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. Clayton Kershaw struck out eight in seven innings, allowing four unearned runs in the seventh thanks to a Juan Uribe error and a Xavier Nady home run. Juan Rivera welcomed himself to his new teammates by hitting a home run on the first pitch he saw as a Dodger. The streak ended the next day as Hiroki Kuroda\\'s bad luck continued. He allowed a three-run homer to Brandon Allen, and that was all the Diamondbacks needed as they held on for a 3–2 win, despite Matt Kemp\\'s 24th homer of the season. Ted Lilly struck out nine batters in 6 2/3 innings on July 17, but he also gave up two home runs, including one to Diamondbacks pitcher Daniel Hudson. Hudson, meanwhile pitched a complete game, and the only run the Dodgers scored in the 4–1 defeat was on a wild pitch. In the game, Lilly became the first Dodger pitcher since Jeff Weaver in 2005 to allow both 20 homers and 20 steals in a season. The Dodgers next traveled to San Francisco to play the first place Giants. Ryan Vogelsong shut down the Dodgers anemic offense, 5–0, to drop them a season worst 13 1/2 games behind the Giants. It was the Dodgers 10th shutout loss of the season. Hong-Chih Kuo allowed a two-run double to Brandon Belt in the seventh inning to lead the Giants to a 5–3 victory over the Dodgers on July 19. With the offense continuing to sputter, ranking next to last in runs scored in the league, the team fired hitting coach Jeff Pentland on July 20.  Assistant hitting coach Dave Hansen was promoted to interim hitting coach for the rest of the season. Clayton Kershaw again snapped the Dodgers losing streak, pitching eight shutout innings while striking out 12 to out duel Giants ace Tim Lincecum on July 20. Dioner Navarro\\'s solo homer into McCovey Cove in the seventh was all the Dodger could muster but it was enough in the 1–0 win. \\n\\nKuroda pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs, including a two-run homer to pitcher John Lannan as the Dodgers lost 7–2 to the Washington Nationals at Dodger Stadium on July 23. Rafael Furcal hit a walk-off double to beat the Nationals the next day as the Dodgers came from three runs behind to win 7–6. Chad Billingsley overcame a shaky first inning to retire 21 of the last 22 batters he faced, striking out 10 in seven innings as the Dodgers picked up a rare series win with a 3–1 victory. Rookie pitchers Rubby De La Rosa and Javy Guerra led the Dodgers to an 8–5 victory over the Colorado Rockies on July 25. De La Rosa threw a career-high 113 pitches, allowing just three hits and a run in six innings. After the bullpen faltered in the ninth, Guerra came in with the bases loaded and retired the Rockies four and five hitters for the save. The Dodgers won their fourth straight the following day, as Kershaw picked up his 12th win of the season with a 3–2 victory. With the trading deadline approaching and much speculation about the possibility of him being traded, Hiroki Kuroda took the mound for the Dodgers on July 27. Kuorda pitched well, allowing only one run in six innings but was saddled with his 13th loss when the Dodgers offense again failed to hit, scoring only 1 run in the 3–1 defeat. Kuroda, despite pitching well all season, became the first Dodger pitcher with back to back 13 loss seasons since Orel Hershiser in 1992 and 1993. Matt Kemp homered and knocked in five runs in the Dodgers 9–5 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks on July 29. Chad Billingsley walked five batters in 5 2/3 innings and they all came around to score as the Dodgers dropped a game to the Diamondbacks 6–4. Meanwhile, Kuroda exercised the \"no-trade clause\" in his contract to ensure he would remain with the team for the remainder of the season. The Dodgers did make a move though, trading injury prone shortstop Rafael Furcal to the St. Louis Cardinals for minor league outfielder Alex Castellanos. The Dodgers month came to a close when Rubby De La Rosa allowed back-to-back home runs to the Diamondbacks in the second inning and the team limped to a 6–3 defeat, finishing off yet another month with a losing record.\\n\\nAugust\\nClayton Kershaw started August off on the right foot, pitching his fourth complete game of the season and picking up his league leading 13th win in the 6–2 road victory over the San Diego Padres. In his first start since electing not to be traded, Hiroki Kuroda was masterful, pitching seven shutout innings while striking out eight as the Dodgers beat the Padres 1–0 for Kuroda\\'s first win since July 1. The news was not all good on the day however, as the team announced that rookie starter Rubby De La Rosa would have to undergo season ending Tommy John surgery. He was 4–5 with a 3.71 ERA for the Dodgers during his 13 appearances (10 starts). Ted Lilly allowed only one run (on a solo homer by Jason Bartlett) in six innings the next day, but it was not enough as Tim Stauffer shut the Dodgers down and the bullpen coughed up a couple more runs in a 3–0 loss to the Padres. Chad Billingsley picked up his 10th win on August 5 against the Arizona Diamondbacks, 7–4. This would be the fifth straight season with double digit wins for Billingsley. The Dodgers scored six runs on seven hits in the third inning to open up the lead. Javy Guerra picked up his first four out save for his 10th of the season. On August 6, the Dodger promoted Nathan Eovaldi from the Double-A Chattanooga Lookouts to make the start against the Diamondbacks. In his Major League debut, he pitched five innings while allowing only two runs and striking out seven. The Dodgers did just enough offensively to get Eovaldi the win, 5–3. Cody Ransom hit a two-run homer in the seventh inning to help the Diamondbacks avoid a sweep and snap Clayton Kershaw\\'s five-game winning streak.\\n\\nThe Dodgers returned home to play the Philadelphia Phillies. The Dodgers feeble offense managed to pound out 13 hits against Phillies ace Roy Halladay, but only scored three runs and fell short 5–3. The Dodgers lost another pitchers\\' duel the following day, 2–1, as Cliff Lee shut down the Dodgers for eight innings and hit a home run to lead the Phillies to the win, despite a good start from Ted Lilly. The Dodgers offense finally woke up against Vance Worley in the final game of the series. They jumped out to a 6–0 lead early thanks to a  Juan Rivera three-run homer. However, Chad Billingsley couldn\\'t make it out of the fifth and Blake Hawksworth gave up a two-run homer to Ryan Howard as the Dodgers lost 9–8, to be swept by the Phillies and extend their losing streak to four games. The Houston Astros, the worst team in the majors, came to Dodger Stadium on August 12, featuring a lineup of mostly recent minor league call-ups. However, the Dodgers still had trouble scoring as Nathan Eovaldi and Bud Norris engaged in a scoreless duel for six innings. The Dodgers finally broke through with a lead off double by Casey Blake in the 10th, followed by a walk-off hit by Matt Kemp for the 1–0 win. Clayton Kershaw picked up his career high 14th win with eight dominate innings against the Astros in a 6–1 Dodger victory. Kemp\\'s two-run homer in the 1st set the tone for the offense. The Dodgers completed their sweep of the Astros with a 7–0 shutout victory on August 14. Hiroki Kuroda went seven, striking out six. Kemp hit his 28th homer and rookie Justin Sellers, who was just called up from the minors two days before, hit a three-run blast for his first career homer.\\n\\nThe Dodgers next went back on the road to face the first place Milwaukee Brewers. Ted Lilly was again sharp, allowing just two hits in seven innings of work, but one of the hits was a solo home run by Ryan Braun. The Brewers added two more solo shots off Dodger relievers in the eighth and won 3–0 as the Dodgers hit into 4 double plays and a triple play and were unable to score against Randy Wolf. The Dodgers had another strong pitching performance from their starter the next day, as Chad Billingsley allowed only one run in seven innings of work, but the Dodgers were unable to solve Yovani Gallardo and the game was tied at 1–1 entering the bottom of the ninth. However, relief pitchers Hong-Chih Kuo and Mike MacDougal were unable to record an out in the inning and the Brewers recorded the 2–1 walk-off win on Mark Kotsay\\'s bases loaded pinch-hit single. The Brewers won another pitching duel from the Dodgers the following day 3–1 despite another strong start by rookie Nathan Eovaldi. Tony Gwynn, Jr. hit his first home run since July 17, 2010 for the Dodgers lone run of the game. Clayton Kershaw helped the Dodgers avoid a sweep by pitching eight shutout innings to pick up his 15th win as the Dodgers won 5–1 on August 18. Kershaw became the first Dodger pitcher to pick up his 15th win before September since Hideo Nomo in 2003. Hiroki Kuroda finally got some run support, picking up the win in the Dodgers 8–2 victory over the Colorado Rockies on August 19. Rod Barajas hit a three-run homer in the third inning as Kuroda allowed two runs in six innings for his seventh consecutive quality start since the all-star break. The Dodgers blew an extra inning lead and lost to the Rockies 7–6 in 13 innings the next day. They had taken the lead in the top of the 12th on a solo homer by Aaron Miles and an inside the park homer by Trent Oeltjen, but rookie closer Javy Guerra blew his first save of the season. A walk-off single by Dexter Fowler in the 13th ended the game. Oeltjen\\'s inside the park homer was the 1st by a Dodger since Blake DeWitt on May 6, 2008. James Loney had 4 hits in 4 at-bats on the 21st, including his 6th homer of the season. Chad Billingsley struck out 7 and only allowed 3 hits in 7 2/3 innings, but was victimized by two 2-run homers by Carlos González and Seth Smith and the Dodgers dropped the finale against the Rockies 5–3. With the win, the Rockies broke a 17-game losing streak in Sunday games, a Major League record. The Dodgers next started a three-game series on the road against the St. Louis Cardinals. Chris Carpenter blanked the Dodgers through eight innings, but the Dodgers rallied in the ninth as Aaron Miles hit an RBI triple off Fernando Salas to tie the score at one and then Rod Barajas hit a grounder to short that former Dodger Rafael Furcal bobbled to allow Miles to score with the winning run. Kershaw picked up his 16th win the next night, pitching six scoreless innings in the Dodgers 13–2 win over the Cardinals. Matt Kemp and Aaron Miles hit solo homers and Rod Barajas hit two homers as the Dodger offense had a rare outburst of power. The Dodgers won the final game of the series 9–4 thanks to a six-run third inning and another effective performance by Hiroki Kuroda. The offensive outburst included the first career home run by A. J. Ellis as the Dodgers picked up their first series sweep of the Cardinals on the road since 1993. The Dodgers also moved ahead in the lifetime series with the Cardinals 1,002 wins to 1,001 for the Cards.\\n\\nThe Dodgers returned home to open a series against the Colorado Rockies. Ted Lilly allowed only one run (on a first-inning homer by Carlos González) in his seven innings of work, but the Dodgers still trailed 1–0 heading into the bottom of the seventh. However, they managed to score six runs in the seventh to win 6–1. James Loney and Matt Kemp hit back-to-back home runs in the inning. For Kemp it was his 30th of the season, joining Raúl Mondesí as the only Dodger members of the 30–30 club. The Dodgers fell behind 4–0 in the second game of the series but battled back with a 5-run sixth to take the lead, only to see Troy Tulowitzki put the Rockies back up with a 2-run homer off struggling reliever Hong-Chih Kuo in the top of the seventh. James Loney hit his second homer in as many days to tie the game in the ninth and Matt Kemp hit his 31st homer, a walk-off shot off Jason Hammel in the 11th. This was the first time Loney had hit home runs in back-to-back days since September 11–12 2007. The Dodgers short winning streak was snapped the next day as rookie starter Nathan Eovaldi allowed five runs to score in the top of the first, thanks in part to a defensive miscue by outfielder Trent Oeltjen. The Dodgers did stage a rally, but still fell shot with a 7–6 loss. Clayton Kershaw allowed only one run on six hits for his fifth complete game of the year and 17th win as the Dodgers defeated the San Diego Padres 4–1 on August 29.  James Loney hit his fifth home run in August, after only hitting four the first three months of the season and the Dodgers clinched their first winning month of the season. The Dodgers scored eight runs in the second inning on August 30 as Tim Stauffer walked six and Andre Ethier hit a grand slam home run. The Dodgers sent 13 batters to the plate that inning, the most since May 25, 2009 against the Rockies. The Dodgers finished the month of August with their second sweep of the Padres, the big blow was a two-run homer by Rod Barajas in the second. The Dodgers August record of 17–11 gave them their first winning month since June 2010.\\n\\nSeptember\\nThe Dodgers traveled to Pittsburgh on September 1 to make up a game that had been rained out on May 12 against the Pirates. Dana Eveland, who had spent the season in AAA with the Albuquerque Isotopes was called up to make the start, his first in the Majors since June 2010. He allowed only one run on six hits in eight innings to collect the win. Some shaky moments from the bullpen made it close in the end, but the Dodgers prevailed 6–4. Chad Billingsley struggled in the opener of a three-game series with the Atlanta Braves and the Dodgers fell behind 5–0. However, Juan Rivera and James Loney each drove in three runs and Dee Gordon had three hits, scored three runs and stole two bases as the Dodgers came from behind to win 8–6, for their 10th win in the last 11 games. The Dodgers scored only two runs the following day but managed to win 2–1 in 10 innings as Dee Gordon hit a standup double to right-center, advanced to third on a sacrifice bunt and scored on a sacrifice fly by Juan Rivera. The Dodgers earlier run came on a solo homer by A. J. Ellis in the second inning. With the win, the Dodgers had their first six-game winning streak of the season. Kershaw held the Braves scoreless through 6 innings the next day, while striking out 10 and the Dodgers built a 3–0 lead on a three-run homer by Matt Kemp. However, a costly error by Aaron Miles in the seventh allowed the Braves to tie the game and the Braves won a walk-off single by Martín Prado in the bottom of the ninth to avoid the sweep and snap the Dodgers winning streak. Hiroki Kuroda gave up three homers in the first inning and four in the game (2 of them to Mike Morse) as the Dodgers fell behind early and never recovered, losing to the Washington Nationals 7–2 on September 6. It was the first time the Dodgers had allowed three homers in the first inning since Fernando Valenzuela did it on June 25, 1988 to the Reds. The last Dodger pitcher to allow four home runs in a game was D. J. Houlton on August 29, 2005. The Nationals young phenom Stephen Strasburg made his first appearance since undergoing Tommy John surgery against the Dodgers on September 6. Strasburg pitched five scoreless innings and had a three-run lead when he left the game, however the Dodgers tied the score with 3 runs in the sixth off the Nationals bullpen. Rod Barajas hit a tie-breaking two-run double in the eighth and Javy Guerra worked out of trouble in the ninth to preserve the 7–3 win. Dodger pitchers (Lilly, Guerrier, Kuo, Jansen and Guerra) combined for 17 strikeouts in the game, a season high. The Dodgers scheduled game on September 7 against the Nationals was rained out and scheduled as a double header the next day. On their off day the Dodgers learned that Andre Ethier would be shut down for the rest of the season while seeking treatment for his injured knee. Juan Rivera smacked two doubles and drove in four runs and Tony Gwynn, Jr. hit a two-out, two-run double in the top of the ninth as the Dodgers won the first game of their scheduled double-header 7–4. The second game was canceled because of continuing rain. The Dodgers traveled west for a series against their rivals, the San Francisco Giants. The first game was the third matchup of the season between Kershaw and Tim Lincecum and like the others it was a great pitching matchup. Linceum allowed only 1 run in his eight innings of work while Kershaw also allowed 1 run (unearned) in eight innings, while striking out nine. The Dodgers pushed across the go-ahead run in the top of the ninth to hand Kershaw his 18th win of the season 2–1. The Dodgers managed to get their record back to .500 for the first time since May 2 when they beat the Giants 3–0 on September 10. Dana Eveland, in his second start of the season, limited the Giants to just three hits in seven + innings. The Dodgers long road trip ended on September 11 with an 8–1 loss to the Giants. Kuroda had his shortest outing of the season, lasting only  4 2/3 innings and then the Giants blew the game open with a five-run sixth inning against the Dodger bullpen. Kuroda became the first Dodger pitcher to lose 16 games in a season since Orel Hershiser in 1987.\\n\\nBack at Dodger Stadium after the long road trip, the Dodgers lost to the first place Arizona Diamondbacks 7–2, thanks to a five-run sixth inning. The Dodgers prevented Diamondbacks starter Ian Kennedy from winning his 20th game by scoring four runs of him in the 1st inning but the offense went into hibernation after that and Gerardo Parra hit a home run off Hong-Chih Kuo to tie the game in the 7th inning. Javy Guerra, in his first two-inning outing in the Majors walked in the go-ahead run in the 10th and the Dodgers lost 5–4. In the series finale, Kershaw allowed only one hit through five innings but was ejected in the sixth inning after hitting Gerardo Parra with a pitch. The bullpen held on and the Dodgers got just enough runs to win 3–2 and get him his 19th win of the season. The Dodgers were officially eliminated from the National League West race the next day, when they lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates 6–2. Pirates starter Ross Ohlendorf hit a three-run homer off of Dana Eveland for the big blow in the game. James Loney hit his first career pinch-hit home run, a three-run blast, in the sixth inning to lead the Dodgers to a 7–2 win over the Pirates the next day. Loney hit another three-run homer the following day, the first Dodger to hit three-run homers in consecutive appearances since Jeff Kent on May 9–10, 2006. The Dodgers won 6–1 and Matt Kemp picked up his 40th stolen base in the game, becoming just the 18th Major Leaguer and first Dodger with at least 30 homers and 40 stolen bases in a season. The Dodgers scored six runs in the second inning on September 18, to bludgeon the Pirates 15–1 to get back to .500. James Loney has a career-high five hits and Jerry Sands and Juan Rivera each had four RBI. The Dodgers began their last home series of the season on September 20 against the Giants with the fourth matchup of the season between Kershaw and Lincecum. Kershaw went 7 1/3 innings, allowed one run and struck out six. He became the Dodgers first 20-game winner since Ramón Martínez in 1990 and the first pitcher to go 5–0 against the Giants in history, beating Lincecum in 4 of those starts. That win moved the Dodgers record above .500 for the first time since April 29, but it didn\\'t last long as Dana Eveland was roughed up in his next start and the Dodgers lost 8–5 to the Giants. Matt Kemp hit a three-run homer in the losing effort, for his 35th of the season. He became the 14th player in Major League history with at least 35 home runs and 35 stolen bases. The Dodgers ended their final home stand of the season with an 8–2 victory over the Giants. Kemp put the exclamation point on his MVP candidacy with a career-high three doubles and a two-run homer and Kuroda allowed only two runs on five hits in seven-plus innings.\\n\\nKemp continued his hot hitting by blasting his 37th home run of the season as the Dodgers beat the San Diego Padres 2–0. Eugenio Vélez, in a rare start, struck out three times to break the 75-year-old MLB record for most at-bats in a season without a hit (0 for 36) and tied a 102-year-old record for most consecutive at-bats without a hit (0 for 45, counting the previous season). The offense was silenced by Aaron Harang the following night and Chad Billingsley, in his final start of the season, allowed three runs in the fifth inning. The Padres held on to beat the Dodgers 3–0. Clayton Kershaw won his 21st game of the season in his final start on September 25 as the Dodgers beat the Padres 6–2. Kershaw clinched the pitching Triple Crown with a 2.28 ERA and 248 strikeouts. Kemp hit a three-run homer the following night as the Dodgers began their last series of the season with a 4–2 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks. The victory assured the Dodgers of a winning record for the season. Hiroki Kuroda, in his final start of the season, pitched six shutout innings and the Dodgers scored five runs in the top of the 10th to lead 6–1 but, with two outs in the bottom of the 10th,  reliever Blake Hawksworth loaded the bases. Javy Guerra came in, walked in a run, and then gave up a walk-off grand slam to Ryan Roberts as the Diamondbacks shocked the Dodgers 7–6. In the final game of the season, Matt Kemp hit his league leading 39th home run and Ted Lilly pitched seven scoreless innings. The Dodgers escaped a poor ninth by reliever Ramón Troncoso and won 7–5 to finish their season at 82–79, third place in the National League West.\\n\\nGame log\\n\\n|-  bgcolor=\"ffbbbb\"\\n|-

Walt Disney Studios has been criticized for including stereotypical portrayal of non-white characters, sexism, and alleged plagiarism. Some of Disney\\'s various business ventures, which include television networks, theme parks, and product lines, have also sparked controversy amongst groups of consumers and media outlets.\\n\\nCompany officials\\n\\nMichael Eisner\\n\\nIn 1977, Roy E. Disney, the son of Disney co-founder Roy O. Disney and nephew of Walt Disney, resigned as an executive due to disagreements with his colleagues\\' decisions at the time. As he claimed later, \"I just felt creatively the company was not going anywhere interesting. It was very stifling.\" However, he retained a seat on the board of directors. His resignation from the board in 1984, which occurred in the midst of a corporate takeover battle, was the beginning of a series of developments that led to the replacement of company president and CEO Ronald William Miller (married to Walt\\'s daughter Diane Marie Disney) by Michael Eisner, Frank Wells, & Jeffrey Katzenberg. Roy soon returned to the company as vice-chairman of the board of directors and head of the animation department.\\n\\nMichael Eisner has been criticized for his management style. The book DisneyWar by James B. Stewart is an exposé of Eisner\\'s 20-year tenure as Chairman and CEO at The Walt Disney Company. Stewart describes some of the following:\\n The struggle to get Who Framed Roger Rabbit made in time and on budget despite the ambitions of Robert Zemeckis and Richard Williams to make the film bigger and bolder\\n Eisner\\'s tension with Frank Wells before Wells\\' death\\n Eisner\\'s friendship-turned-rivalry with Jeffrey Katzenberg\\n Eisner\\'s tension with Michael Ovitz during Ovitz\\'s short-lived presidency\\n The purchase of the ABC Family channel and its content and the fallout resulting from Disney\\'s inability to revive it\\n Hilary Duff\\'s decision to quit the Disney Channel because of low salary\\n Financing of the film Fahrenheit 9/11\\n Pixar\\'s decision not to renew its relationship with Disney\\n The hostile takeover attempt by Comcast.\\n\\nIn 2003, Roy resigned from his positions as Disney vice chairman and chairman of Walt Disney Feature Animation, accusing Eisner of micromanagement, flops with the ABC television network, timidity in the theme park business, turning The Walt Disney Company into a \"rapacious, soul-less\" company, and refusing to establish a clear succession plan, as well as a string of box-office movie flops starting in the year 2000.\\n\\nOn March 3, 2004, at Disney\\'s annual shareholders\\' meeting, a surprising 43% of Disney\\'s shareholders, predominantly rallied by former board members Roy Disney and Stanley Gold, withheld their proxies to re-elect Eisner to the board. Disney\\'s board then gave the chairmanship position to George J. Mitchell. However, the board did not immediately remove Eisner as chief executive.\\n\\nOn March 13, 2005, Eisner announced that he would step down as CEO one year before his contract expired. On September 30, Eisner resigned both as an executive and as a member of the board of directors, and, severing all formal ties with the company, he waived his contractual rights to perks such as the use of a corporate jet and an office at the company\\'s Burbank headquarters. Eisner\\'s replacement was his longtime assistant, Robert Iger.\\n\\nWalt Disney Studios\\n\\nWalt Disney Animation Studios\\n\\nEthnic and racial stereotyping\\nOver the years many scholars, film critics, and parent groups have been critical of Disney for the stereotypical portrayal of non-white characters, which they attributed to Walt Disney being racist. For example, during a story meeting on Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, he referred to the scene when the dwarfs pile on top of each other as a \"[N-word] pile\" and during casting of Song of the South he used the term pickaninny. \\n\\nOther examples cited included the short Mickey\\'s Mellerdrammer where Mickey Mouse dresses in blackface; the stereotypical \"Black\" Bird in the short Who Killed Cock Robin?; Sunflower the half-zebra/half-African servant centaurette in Fantasia; the film Song of the South, which depicts an idealized version of the lives of former slaves; the depiction of Native American \\'Indians\\' as savages in Peter Pan; the cunning and manipulative Siamese cats Si and Am in Lady and the Tramp; and the poor and uneducated crows in Dumbo.\\n\\nSince its release in 1992, Disney\\'s Aladdin has been accused of perpetuating racial and ethnic stereotypes of Arabs. In July 1993, Disney announced that it would alter a line in the film\\'s opening song, \"Arabian Nights\", written by Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. In the original film, the song featured the lyrics, \"Where they cut off your ear if they don\\'t like your face/It\\'s barbaric, but hey, it\\'s home.\" After Arab-American groups complained that the line was derogatory to Middle Easterners, Disney amended the lyrics in later editions of the film to an alternate lyric written by Ashman: \"Where it\\'s flat and immense and the heat is intense/It\\'s barbaric, but hey, it\\'s home.\" Menken approved the change before its adoption, as did the estate of Ashman, who had died before the film\\'s completion.\\n\\nThe American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee further requested that the word \"barbaric\" be removed; however, Disney refused this, claiming that the word appeared in all versions of Ashman\\'s text and it referred to the film\\'s desert setting in the altered lyrics. Don Bustany, president of the ADC\\'s Los Angeles chapter, argued that the existing alterations were \"nowhere near adequate, considering the racism depicted in Aladdin...there still remains the very sleazy, burlesque character in the prologue and the scene where a merchant is going to cut off the hand of Princess Jasmine because she took an apple from his stand to give to a hungry child.\"\\n\\nA March 1995 article published on the ADC\\'s website further criticized Aladdin for depicting the film\\'s protagonists, Aladdin and Jasmine, with light skin and Anglicized features in contrast to dark-skinned merchants and palace guards who were cruel, greedy, and vicious while featuring Arab accents and distorted facial features. Shortly after the film\\'s release, Jack Shaheen, a professor of mass communications at Southern Illinois University, said that \"Aladdin is not an entertaining Arabian Nights fantasy as film critics would have us believe, but rather a painful reminder to 3 million Americans of Arab heritage, as well as 300 million Arabs and others, that the abhorrent Arab stereotype is as ubiquitous as Aladdin\\'s lamp.\"\\n\\nSexism\\nIn 1938, The Walt Disney Company sent a rejection letter to Mary Ford, stating that \"girls are not considered\" for creative positions. The letter was rediscovered in 2009 when Ford\\'s grandson uploaded the image on Flickr. The letter received greater attention on January 7, 2014, when, after congratulating Emma Thompson for her Best Actress win at the National Board of Review Awards, Meryl Streep referenced the letter. Referencing Thompson\\'s film, Saving Mr. Banks, Streep responded \"It must have killed [Disney] to encounter a woman, an equally disdainful and superior creature, a person dismissive of his own considerable gifts and prodigious output and imagination.\" \\n\\nIn response to Streep\\'s statements, many Disney scholars and artists defended Disney, including Disney Legend Floyd Norman, who said \"Much has changed, and changed for the better.\" Other journalists found the speech ironic, noting that Streep just finished filming the then-upcoming Disney film, Into the Woods.\\n\\nThe Walt Disney Company has also been criticized for the lack of feminist values seen in the older, original Disney Princesses. Snow White in particular is under constant criticism for her lack of feminist ideals. The film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) features a main protagonist who, at the time, fit the domestic and docile expectations of women in the pre-World War II era. Snow White is displayed on screen covered in a long dress, embellished with a white collar, puffy sleeves, red cape, and a red bow constraining her hair; a traditional, modest feminine look that reveals minimal skin. Through her actions portrayed in the movie, she draws on the traditional femininity that was encouraged in 1930s American culture. In the midst of the Great Depression, women were encouraged to return to the home and care for the household, a theme that is widely displayed in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. \\n\\nHowever, with the second resurgence of Disney movies (known as the Disney Renaissance) beginning in 1989 and ending in 1999, Disney transformed the damsel in distress into a strong woman with a desire for adventure. This new approach ushered in a decade of go-getting, proactive heroines who possessed character traits that coincided with the new era of acceptable roles in a society where women hold the same jobs as men. This is evident in princesses such as Ariel from The Little Mermaid (1989), and Belle from Beauty and the Beast (1991).\\n\\nPlagiarism\\nSeveral of Disney\\'s animated feature films have been accused of plagiarizing existing works. The most notable and controversial example is The Lion King, which critics allege was plagiarized from Osamu Tezuka\\'s Japanese manga ジャングル大帝 Janguru Taitei i.e. Jungle Emperor  and its anime adaptation of the same name (in Japan). This TV series was in turn dubbed and retitled Kimba the White Lion for English-speaking audiences by Titan Productions for NBC from 1965 to 1966, and it premiered on Los Angeles\\' KHJ-TV in September 1966. After Kimba\\'s original run in the United States ended in the autumn of 1967, the series was shown in syndication on TV stations across the U.S. through September 30, 1978. \\n\\nAs a number of media journalists and fans watched The Lion King after its initial release in 1994, they noticed characters and events in the story resembling those of Kimba. Although the two works follow different screenplays, there are strong artistic similarities, and The Lion King contains numerous sequences that closely match up with Kimba′s. Other similarities are thematically deeper and more pronounced, such as that both feature the theme of the circle of life. Alleged similarities in the characters, beginning with the protagonist lion cubs Kimba and Simba, include the evil lions, the one-eyed Claw and Scar, the sage baboons Dan\\'l Baboon and Rafiki, the animated birds Pauley Cracker and Zazu, and the pair of hyena sidekicks (it was a trio in the Disney film). \\n\\nThe Lion King co-director Rob Minkoff deflected criticism of similarities in the characters by stating it was \"not unusual to have characters like a baboon, a bird or hyenas\" in films set in Africa. Both films feature the protagonist looking up at cloudbursts in the shape of his father lion, as pointed out by Frederick L. Schodt. The similarity is alluded to in a scene from The Simpsons episode \\'Round Springfield\", where a parody of Mufasa (voiced by Harry Shearer) in the clouds tells Lisa Simpson, \"You must avenge my death, Kimba...dah, I mean Simba!\".\\n\\nMatthew Broderick has said that when he was hired as the voice of adult Simba in The Lion King, he presumed the project was related to Kimba the White Lion. \"I thought he meant Kimba, who was a white lion in a cartoon when I was a little kid,\" said Broderick. \"So I kept telling everybody I was going to play Kimba. I didn\\'t really know anything about it, but I didn\\'t really care.\" In addition, a memo written by Roy E. Disney in July 1993 refers to Simba as \"Kimba\", causing critics to claim that Disney was aware of the similarities.\\n\\nUpon the release of The Lion King in Japan, multiple Japanese cartoonists including Machiko Satonaka signed a letter urging the Walt Disney Company acknowledge due credit to Jungle Emperor Leo in the making of The Lion King. As Tim Hornyak wrote in The Japan Times, \"The Tezuka–Disney connection extends back decades before the movie. Tezuka met Walt Disney at the 1964 New York World\\'s Fair, and Disney said he hoped to \"make something just like\" Tezuka\\'s Astro Boy.The Lion King director Roger Allers claimed he remained unfamiliar with Kimba throughout production until his movie was nearly completed; co-director Rob Minkoff also said he was unfamiliar with Kimba.\\n\\nThe other Disney film, Atlantis: The Lost Empire (2001), was alleged for plagiarizing the Japanese animated series as well; many critics and viewers alike claimed it was plagiarized from one of the popular anime television shows ふしぎの海のナディア Fushigi no Umi no Nadia i.e. Nadia of the Mysterious Seas (Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water) , more specifically in its character designs, setting and storyline. As noted by the viewers in Japan and America, the similarities became strong enough to call its production company Gainax to sue for plagiarism. They only refrained from doing so, according to Gainax member Yasuhiro Takeda, because the decision belonged to parent companies NHK and Toho. Hiroyuki Yamaga, another Gainax worker, was quoted in an interview in 2000 as: \"We actually tried to get NHK to pick a fight with Disney, but even the National Television Network of Japan didn\\'t dare to mess with Disney and their lawyers. [...] We actually did say that but we wouldn\\'t actually take them to court. We would be so terrified about what they would do to them in return that we wouldn\\'t dare.\"\\n\\nAlthough Disney never responded formally to those claims, co-director Kirk Wise posted on a Disney animation newsgroup in May 2001, \"Never heard of Nadia till it was mentioned in this [newsgroup]. Long after we\\'d finished production, I might add.\" He claimed both Atlantis and Nadia were inspired, in part, by Jules Verne\\'s 1870 novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seas. Speaking about the clarification, however, Lee Zion of Anime News Network wrote, \"There are too many similarities not connected with 20,000 Leagues for the whole thing to be coincidence.\" As such, the whole affair ultimately entered popular culture as a convincing case of plagiarism. In 2018, Reuben Baron of Comic Book Resources added to Zion\\'s comment stating, \"Verne didn\\'t specifically imagine magic crystal-based technology, something featured in both the Disney movie and the two similar anime. The Verne inspiration also doesn\\'t explain the designs being suspiciously similar to Nadias.\"\\n\\nIn March 2014, animator Kelly Wilson sued Disney for plagiarism, alleging that the teaser trailer for Frozen was similar to her short film The Snowman. After four months of legal battling, federal judge Vince Chhabria ruled in Wilson\\'s favor, citing evidence that Disney was aware of The Snowman and \"the sequence of both works, from start to finish, is too parallel to conclude that no reasonable juror could find the works substantially similar.\" In April 2015, Chhabria explained that several Pixar employees had attended the 2011 San Francisco International Film Festival, in which The Snowman was screened four times alongside the Pixar short Play by Play. In June 2015, Entertainment Weekly reported that Disney had agreed to settle the case.\\n\\nIn March 2017, a year after the release of Disney\\'s animated film Zootopia, screenwriter and producer Gary Goldman sued Disney, claiming that he had pitched a similar idea to the studio in 2000 and again in 2009. According to a story in The Hollywood Reporter, Goldman alleged that Disney had stolen the film\\'s title and various artwork from him after he offered the project. A Disney spokesperson dismissed the accusations, declaring that \"Mr. Goldman\\'s lawsuit is riddled with patently false allegations. It is an unprincipled attempt to lay claim to a successful film he didn\\'t create, and we will vigorously defend against it in court.\"\\n\\nLGBT references in Disney films\\n\\nControversy was stirred in the live-action remake Beauty and the Beast (2017), when director Bill Condon announced that Lefou would come out as a gay character and dance with a man named Stanley. As a result, a theater in Henagar, Alabama refused to screen the film.\\n\\nIn March 2020, the Pixar animated film Onward introduced the first openly lesbian character in Disney media named Officer Specter, voiced by the real-life lesbian actress Lena Waithe, who discusses that her girlfriend\\'s daughter gets her pulling her hair out. This resulted to the film receiving backlash in several Middle Eastern countries such as Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. The film is also censored in Russia, where the gay propaganda law officially criminalizes the dissemination of LGBT-related content to children under 18.\\n\\nPixar\\'s relationship with Disney\\nPixar and Disney had disagreements after the production of Toy Story 2. Originally intended as a straight-to-video release (and thus not part of Pixar\\'s five-picture deal), the film was eventually upgraded to a theatrical release during production. Pixar demanded that the film then be counted toward the five-picture agreement, but Disney refused. Pixar\\'s first five feature films had collectively grossed more than $2.5 billion, equivalent to the highest per-film average gross in the industry. Though profitable for both, Pixar later complained that the arrangement was not equitable. Pixar was responsible for creation and production, while Disney handled marketing and distribution. Profits and production costs were split 50-50, but Disney exclusively owned all story and sequel rights and also collected a distribution fee. The lack of story and sequel rights was perhaps the most onerous aspect to Pixar and set the stage for a contentious relationship.\\n\\nThe two companies attempted to reach a new agreement in early 2004. The new deal would be only for distribution, as Pixar intended to control production and own the resulting film properties themselves. The company also wanted to finance their films on their own and collect 100 percent of the profits, paying Disney only the 10 to 15 percent distribution fee. More importantly, as part of any distribution agreement with Disney, Pixar demanded control over films already in production under their old agreement, including The Incredibles and Cars. Disney considered these conditions unacceptable, but Pixar would not concede.\\n\\nDisagreements between Steve Jobs and then-Disney Chairman and CEO Michael Eisner made the negotiations more difficult than they otherwise might have been. They broke down completely in mid-2004, with Jobs declaring that Pixar was actively seeking partners other than Disney. Pixar did not enter negotiations with other distributors. After a lengthy hiatus, negotiations between the two companies resumed following the departure of Eisner from Disney in September 2005. In preparation for potential fallout between Pixar and Disney, Jobs announced in late 2004 that Pixar would no longer release movies at the Disney-dictated November time frame, but during the more lucrative early summer months. This would also allow Pixar to release DVDs during the Christmas shopping season. An added benefit of delaying Cars was to extend the time frame remaining on the Pixar-Disney contract to see how things would play out between the two companies.\\n\\nPending the Disney acquisition of Pixar in 2006, the two companies created a distribution deal for the intended 2007 release of Ratatouille, in case the acquisition fell through, to ensure that this one film would still be released through Disney\\'s distribution channels (in contrast to the earlier Pixar deal, Ratatouille was to remain a Pixar property and Disney would have received only a distribution fee). The completion of Disney\\'s Pixar acquisition, however, nullified this distribution arrangement.\\n\\nMiramax and its handling of foreign films\\nFormerly a subsidiary of Disney from 1993 to 2010, Miramax has come under criticism for its editing, dubbing, and replacing the soundtracks of various foreign films that it releases. One notable example is Iron Monkey which, though released subtitled, had its subtitles altered to remove the political context of the story; had scenes trimmed and changed for violence and pacing; and had the soundtrack changed, removing the famous Wong Fei Hung theme. Other films that they have altered in this way include Shaolin Soccer; Farewell My Concubine (theatrical release); The Thief and the Cobbler; and Jet Li\\'s Fist of Legend.\\n\\nPeter Biskind\\'s book Down and Dirty Pictures details many of the Weinsteins\\' dishonest dealings with filmmakers.\\n\\nUnder the Weinsteins, Miramax had a history of buying the rights to Asian films, only to sit on them without releasing them for years. One example of this is Hero, a 2002 Chinese martial arts film. It languished in Miramax\\'s vaults for two years before it was salvaged with the intervention of Quentin Tarantino. Another example is Tears of the Black Tiger, a Thai film originally released in 2000. After changing the film\\'s ending, Tears of the Black Tiger sat in Miramax\\'s vaults for five years until its rights were purchased by Magnolia Pictures in 2006.\\n\\nA \"no cuts\" policy was highlighted when Miramax co-chairman Harvey Weinstein demanded edits to the Japanese anime film Princess Mononoke to make it more marketable. In response, Toshio Suzuki, a producer at Studio Ghibli, sent an authentic katana with a simple message: \"No cuts\". According to promotion manager Steve Alpert, when Weinstein initially found out about this, he flew into a rage, threatening Alpert that he would \"never work in this... industry again\". He eventually gave in, however, and the film was released uncut.\\n\\nOne reason for the delays and non-releases of films was an accounting scheme that the Weinsteins used to shift potential money-losing films to future fiscal years and ensure they would receive annual bonuses from Disney, while trying to bar retailers from legally exporting authentic DVDs of the films.\\n\\nDefenders of the company point out that, prior to Miramax, most of the films purchased by the company would have had little to no chance of achieving U.S. distribution other than by very small distributors with minimal marketing expertise and funds. They also state that the purpose of the company\\'s aggressive re-editing technique was always to try to help the films find a broader American audience than they might otherwise find. \"I\\'m not cutting for fun\", Harvey Weinstein said in an interview, \"I\\'m cutting for the shit to work. All my life I served one master: the film. I love movies.\"\\n\\nMiramax is also accused of ignoring their more artistic, less audience-friendly films, especially when directors refuse to re-cut them to make them less challenging. Dead Man, which director Jim Jarmusch refused to re-cut, got a very limited release and critics have accused the Weinsteins of burying the film.\\n\\nMiramax was parodied in the Kevin Smith film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001), in which the studio attempted to adapt Jay and Silent Bob\\'s comic book characters, Bluntman and Chronic, into a movie, thus resulting in the duo traveling to Hollywood to stop them from making the movie. According to Kevin Smith, this film is a direct response to the controversy surrounding his previous film Dogma.\\n\\nWalt Disney Television\\nAmerican Broadcasting Company\\nOn February 9, 1996, The Walt Disney Company acquired Capital Cities/ABC, and renamed the broadcasting group ABC, Inc., although the network also continues to use American Broadcasting Companies, such as on TV productions it owns.\\n\\nABC\\'s relationship with Disney dates back to 1953 when Leonard Goldenson pledged enough money so that the \"Disneyland\" theme park could be completed. ABC continued to hold Disney notes and stock until 1960, and also had first call on the \"Disneyland\" television series in 1954. \\n\\nWith this new relationship came an attempt at cross-promotion, with attractions based on ABC, shows at Disney parks and an annual soap festival at Walt Disney World (the former president of ABC, Inc., Robert Iger, now heads Disney). In 1997, ABC aired a Saturday morning block called One Saturday Morning\\'\\'\\', which changed to ABC Kids in 2002. It featured a five-hour line-up of children\\'s shows (mostly cartoons) for children ages 5–12, but it was changed to a four-hour line-up in 2005. Since then, it was aimed for children more in the 10–16 age range.\\n\\nDespite intense micro-managing on the part of Disney management, the flagship television network was slow to turn around. In 1999, the network was able to experience a brief bolster in ratings with the hit game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire. A new national phenomenon, Survivor, on CBS persuaded the schedulers at ABC to change Millionaires slot over to the Wednesday Time slot at 8:00 to kill Survivor before it got ratings to hold. The first results were promising for CBS; they lost by only a few rating points. ABC tried to keep the strength running, so they tried an unprecedented strategy for Millionaire by airing the show four times a week during the next fall season, in the process overexposing the show, as it appeared on the network sometimes five or six nights during a week. \\n\\nABC\\'s ratings fell dramatically as competitors introduced their own game shows and the public grew tired of the format. Alex Wallau took over as president in 2000. Despite the repeated overexposure of Millionaire and its switch to syndication, ABC continued to find some success in dramas such as The Practice (which gave birth to a successful spinoff, Boston Legal, in 2004); Alias; and Once and Again. ABC also had some moderately successful comedies including The Drew Carey Show; Spin City; Dharma & Greg; According to Jim; My Wife and Kids; and George Lopez.\\n\\nStill, one asset that ABC lacked in the early 2000s that most other networks had was popularity in reality television. ABC\\'s briefly-lived reality shows Are You Hot? and I\\'m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! proved to be an embarrassment for the network. By the end of the 2003–2004 television season, ABC slumped to fourth place, becoming the first of the original \"Big Three\" networks to fall into such ratings.\\n\\nABC Daytime\\n\\n When Megan McTavish returned as head writer of All My Children in July 2003, she faced criticism for a story that depicted the rape of a lesbian character, Bianca Montgomery. The show also faced opposition to its story of a transgender character in 2006.\\n ABC Daytime scrapped a One Life to Live storyline which was to depict a school shooting rampage on the day the Virginia Tech massacre occurred on April 16, 2007.\\n The Writers Guild of America East filed arbitration suits against ABC Daytime, claiming that they violated the strike-termination agreement by retaining replacement writers (those who choose Financial Core Status) who filled in during the strike on All My Children instead of bringing back the writers who had been on strike.\\n The ABC Network as a whole has been criticized for the cancellations of both One Life to Live and All My Children as well as the near-cancellation of its one remaining soap opera General Hospital.\\n\\n\"The strike-termination agreement does not allow the retention of replacement writers in lieu of allowing striking writers to return to their jobs. ABC Daytime are clearly violating this agreement,\" said Ira Cure, senior counsel for the WGA East, in a statement. \"They have left us no other option but to file arbitrations to ensure that our members will be afforded their rights outlined under this agreement.\" Broadcasting & Cable: Arbitration Suit Against ABC-D\\n In December 2008, Soap Opera Weekly/Soap Opera Digest critic Marlena De Lacroix called ABC Daytime a \"chauvinistic hellhole\".\\n\\nIn August 2009, Frons announced that the production of All My Children would move from New York City to Los Angeles by the end of the year.\\n\\nABC News\\n\\nOn April 30, 2004, Nightline host Ted Koppel read the names of the members of the United States Armed Forces who were killed in Iraq. This prompted controversy from conservatives, who believed that Koppel was making a political statement, and from Sinclair Broadcasting Group, which felt that ABC was undermining the Iraq war effort. Others, including a The Washington Post television columnist, thought it was a ratings stunt for sweeps, and indeed Nightline was the highest-rated program during that time period, and had about 30% more viewers than other Nightline programs that week. Sinclair stations did not air the program.\\n\\nKoppel repeated the format on May 28, 2004, reading the names of service members killed in Afghanistan, and on May 30, 2005, reading the names of all service members killed in Afghanistan or Iraq between the last program and the preparation of the program. This time, Sinclair stations aired the program as scheduled.\\n\\nIn the wake of the job cuts, a significant controversy erupted online in May 2010 after it was announced the former VP of news coverage, Mimi Gurbst, was leaving the network to become a guidance counselor. A story in the New York Observer reported that Gurbst was a \"cherished\" mentor inside the news division. Reporters who closely follow TV news observed that a large number of current and former ABC News staffers went online to vigorously respond that Gurbst had helped perpetuate a negative culture with ABC News.\\n\\nThe Path to 9/11\\n\\nABC aired the controversial two-part miniseries The Path to 9/11 in the US on September 10, 2006, at 8 p.m. EDT and September 11, 2006, at 8 p.m. EDT. The extensive pre-broadcast controversy over the film has included disputes over the accuracy of its dramatization of key events, as well as calls by historians and from former Clinton and Bush administration officials for ABC to re-edit part of the film or to not broadcast it at all. According to the official statement released by ABC on September 7, 2006, the film is a dramatization, not a documentary, drawn from a variety of sources, including The 9/11 Commission Report, other published materials, and personal interviews.\\n\\nThe main source of the controversy stems from portions of the film concerned with the Clinton administration in the 1990s. Critics say that certain dramatized scenes tend to suggest that blame for the events that took place on September 11, 2001, lies with Clinton and his cabinet. One example cited is a scene in which then-National Security Advisor Sandy Berger does not approve of the order to take out a surrounded Osama bin Laden, tells the squad in Afghanistan that they will have to do the job without official authorization and then hangs up the phone. According to Sandy Berger and others\\xa0– including conservative author and Clinton critic Richard Miniter\\xa0– this never happened. Screenwriter Cyrus Nowrasteh has now admitted that the abrupt hang-up was not in the script and was improvised.\\n\\nAmerican Airlines reportedly threatened to pull its advertising from ABC after this program aired. The liberal watchdog group Media Matters for America named ABC its third annual \"Misinformer of the Year\" award in 2006, not only for the miniseries, but for the alleged conservative pandering of ABC News director Mark Halperin and for biased claims on news programs such as ABC World News and Good Morning America.\\n\\nAlexis Debat\\nAlexis Debat, a consultant for ABC for years and also a writer for The National Interest, resigned from ABC in June 2007 after the broadcasting company discovered that he did not have a Ph.D. from the Sorbonne as he pretended. Furthermore, in September 2007, the French news media Rue 89 revealed that he had made at least two bogus interviews, one of Barack Obama and another of Alan Greenspan, both published in the French magazine Politique internationale.Pascal Riché, Après la fausse interview d\\'Obama, celle de Greenspan, Rue 89, September 13, 2007  This in turn also led to his resignation from The National Interest. Debat had specialized in reports on terrorism and national security for the past six years (writing, for example, on the Jundallah Balochi and Sunni organization).Alexis Debat, Crackdown on the Secret War Against Iran, ABC News, April 13, 2007\\n\\nABC contract dispute affecting WABC-TV and WPVI\\nOn March 2, 2010, WABC-TV in New York, along with Philadelphia sister station WPVI (carried in Mercer, Monmouth, and Ocean counties), stated that they would pull their programming from Cablevision on March 7, 2010 (at midnight), unless a new payment structure was implemented for its network programming. Cablevision responded by citing WABC-TV and WPVI\\'s free, over-the-air accessibility. Cablevision spokesman Charles Schueler stated, \"It is not fair for ABC-Disney to hold Cablevision customers hostage by forcing them to pay what amounts to a new TV tax.\"\\n\\nThe removal of both stations occurred on the weekend of the 82nd Academy Awards, which was scheduled to be one of ABC\\'s largest yearly specials, and was projected to cause a devastating blow to advertisers for the Oscars and to Cablevision itself.\\n\\nOn Sunday, March 7, 2010 at 12:01\\xa0a.m. ET, both WABC and WPVI were removed from Cablevision, leaving a black screen in their place, confirming the rumors that if a deal with Cablevision and ABC was not reached by midnight, the network and other Disney-owned channels would go off the air.\\n\\nCablevision began looping a public service announcement on each affected channel and forcing all of its customers\\' set-top boxes to channel 1999, which was looping the same announcement, much like was done when Scripps Networks pulled their cable channels\\' programming. Besides providing certain details of the disagreement they stated that ABC shows could be watched online through TV websites such as Hulu.\\n\\nAlso that day, Cablevision announced through e-mail that their entire film catalog of on-demand movies would be available without charge until midnight that evening as an apology to their customers.\\n\\nAt 8:50\\xa0p.m. that day, WABC and WPVI returned to Cablevision\\'s programming, after notification during the 82nd Academy Awards announced progression in \"Work to complete our negotiations\", and the return of ABC\\'s programming during the negotiations.\\n\\nFreeform\\nFox Family Worldwide Inc was sold to Disney for $2.9 billion on October 24, 2001. The sale to Disney also included TV channel Fox Kids and Saban Entertainment (renamed BVS Entertainment). The entire network was officially renamed ABC Family on November 10, 2001.July 23, 2001  Disney buying Fox Family Channel\\n\\nThe sale to Disney was considered one of the largest mistakes or problems occurring during the tenure of Michael Eisner. The failure was primarily due to the acquisition being done by the strategic planning department of Disney, without consulting anyone at ABC. The original plan was to use the channel to essentially show re-runs of ABC programming, but this plan was completely impossible since ABC had no syndication rights to the majority of their own programs. During this time, the network did air same-season repeats of Alias, Less Than Perfect, Life with Bonnie, and The Bachelor, almost all of which were Touchstone Television productions (The Bachelor is distributed by Time Warner\\'s Telepictures). But in trying to change the focus of the channel, Disney also canceled several Fox Family series, like State of Grace, and cut back on the network\\'s TV movies, which were among the few programs Fox Family was doing well with. The ratings tumbled further as the network became dependent on syndicated reruns and no original programs (save for original wrap-around segments around Bachelor repeats, and children\\'s programming).\\n\\nThe next major plan was to reposition the channel to market it to college students, young women, or to a more hip audience under the name XYZ, a reverse reference to ABC. Disney soon found that the channel could never be renamed as such. The original sale from CBN to Fox/Saban contained a (now disputed) stipulation that the channel contains the word \"Family\" in the name forever, no matter who owns the network. To create XYZ, the Family Channel would have had to cease to exist\\xa0– terminating all existing cable TV contracts\\xa0– and XYZ would have to be created as a completely new network. Cable companies would not be obligated to put XYZ in the spot vacated by the Family Channel. ABC scrapped the idea after discovering this clause.\\n\\nThe name was revisited at one point in 2003, serving as a program block entitled \"The XYZ\", showing programs and movies aimed at the above groups. The network was also used as a buffer to burn off failed ABC series, such as All American Girl, which featured former Spice Girl Geri Halliwell.\\n\\nSince 2006, the critics have gone after programming on ABC Family. Most critics of the network feel it has gone from a family friendly to \"too risqué\", and shows like Greek and The Secret Life of the American Teenager are far too racy for \"family viewers\". Critics feel that the executives at ABC Family are only after viewership numbers and are unconcerned about showing younger generations in questionable scenarios in series and films. The main focus of criticism is on teenage pregnancy or underage drinking.\\n\\nDespite the channel\\'s name including the word \"Family\", the channel\\'s programming content standards had changed several years earlier after the sale of the channel by International Family Entertainment, and the channel had been airing even some acquired series and movies that contain profanity, violence and sexual content or dialogue after the sale, particularly since being purchased by The Walt Disney Company. ABC Family did air parental advisory tags at the beginning of some TV-14 rated programs, such as That \\'70s Show and some episodes of The Secret Life of the American Teenager.\\nIn 2015, a survey revealed that viewers who only watched the channel occasionally thought that the channel was entirely family-friendly. As a result, the channel was rebranded as Freeform on January 12, 2016. This change was made in order to establish the network as a general entertainment channel. Despite this, family-oriented shows and movies continue to air on the network.\\n\\nDisney Channel\\nDisney Channel has come under heavy criticism in some time. Some critics disapprove of the marketing strategy made by Anne Sweeney, the former President of the Disney-ABC Television Group from 2004 to 2014 (1996–2014 as the President of Disney Channel), in which Disney Channel\\'s programming has geared mainly towards preteen and teenage girls with a decrease in animated programming. Criticism was also aimed at removing almost all Walt-era and pre-1990s material from the channel in 2002 with the removal of the late-night \"Vault Disney\" block devoted to this material, which used to make up the majority of the channel\\'s programming since its inception in 1983.\\n\\nESPN\\n\\nCriticism of ESPN is mostly concerning the journalistic standards of the network vs. the entertainment division.\\n\\nOne such event came in 2010 when ESPN gave one hour of time, and the advertising money that goes with it, to NBA superstar LeBron James so he could announce where he would play during the 2010-11 NBA season. This program was called The Decision and received criticism because ESPN ceded control of the hour to an outside source, and the person doing the interview was Jim Gray, who was not an ESPN employee. This is in addition to the hours of hype preceding the special which was in the form of a three-hour SportsCenter telecast.\\n\\nThere was a Texas Tech scandal, which involved ESPN College Football analyst Craig James. Through James, ESPN used its power to get head coach Mike Leach fired because of how James\\'s son, Adam, was treated following a concussion.\\n\\nESPN has also been accused of overpaying for sports broadcasting rights, and that Wall Street analysts have raised concerns that this could be a major drain on Disney as a whole, since the amount of money that can be recuperated from retransmission consent fees and advertising is limited; Disney still profits from the ESPN division but as of 2015 was cutting the network\\'s higher-priced content to ensure long-term profitability. In October 2015, ESPN laid off about 300 employees, citing the rights costs combined with the increasing trend of cord-cutting.\\n\\nIn November 2019, ESPN\\'s owner The Walt Disney Company launched the streaming service called Disney+. ESPN was soon accused of throwing its journalistic integrity out of the window with its decidedly unabashed shilling of Disney+. For example, there was a Simpsons-themed SportsCenter \"Top 10\" to star NFL reporter Adam Schefter tweeting that Disney+ \"will change lives\". Writing in Slate, Laura Wagner said that the \"tongue bath\" for Disney+ \"represents a new inflection point in ESPN\\'s decline from journalistic institution to entertainment company\". Wagner added \"This clumsy marketing blitz is an embarrassing exercise that turns ostensible reporters into stooges. It\\'s also a stark example of just how flimsy ESPN\\'s editorial vision has become.\" Meanwhile, Kelly McBride of the nonprofit journalism organization the Poynter Institute in an interview with The Washington Post said \"You\\'re turning the journalist into a salesperson and asking them to upsell the product. That\\'s not the relationship you want the journalist to have with the audience member. You want that relationship to be about trust in the journalist\\'s expertise.\"\\n\\nWalt Disney Parks and Resorts\\nDisneyland Resort\\nAl Lutz\\'s Disneyland reports\\nAl Lutz, who has written about Disney since the 1990s, often writes about a perceived decline in value and quality at Disney\\'s theme parks, chiefly Disneyland and its neighboring park Disney California Adventure that opened in 2001. Much of his criticism was directed at Paul Pressler, the one-time president of Disneyland who later was named chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, and Cynthia Harriss, Pressler\\'s successor as Disneyland\\'s president. From 1996-2002, Lutz maintained a set of sarcastic Web pages called Promote Paul Pressler!, whose stated goal was \"getting current Disneyland Resort President Paul Pressler promoted to a new job somewhere else within The Walt Disney Company!\"\\n\\nLutz\\'s July 2006 report on the alleged antics of Lindsay Lohan during a private party held at Disneyland for her 20th birthday drew a rebuke from a representative for the actress, who said that reports of bad behavior were \"complete bull\". This report brought Lutz\\'s website, MiceAge, briefly into the spotlight, and established Lutz as a Disney watchdog in the mainstream media.\\n\\nIn late 2007, mainstream media outlets including The New York Times; the Los Angeles Times; the Associated Press; and foreign newspapers referenced claims made in two of Lutz\\'s columns. One was about a planned refurbishment of the \"it\\'s a small world\" attraction at Disneyland that would modify the ride\\'s boat and flume trough to accommodate boats capable of carrying heavier park guests, a claim that Disney has consistently denied in subsequent media coverage.\\n\\nDisney California Adventure\\nDisney California Adventure, originally named Disney\\'s California Adventure Park until a name change in June 2010, was expected to draw large crowds when it opened in 2001. A January 14, 2001 Los Angeles Times article titled \"The most Jam-Packed Theme Park on Earth?\" stated \"Senior Disney officials acknowledge that there will be days when California Adventure will have to turn patrons away, particularly in the first weeks after the park opens, during spring break and again in the summer.\" The actual attendance was not close to the size that Disney expected for the park back in 2001.\\n\\nThe reasons for this has been speculated as:\\n Bad word-of-mouth from early visitors discouraged future visitors, stating the park was lacking in Disney-quality attractions.\\n Hollywood Pictures Backlot had a lack of focus on the restaurants, shops, and attractions.\\n Lack of rides for young children.\\n The park\\'s Californian theme was criticized as being redundant, seeing as the park itself was located in the same state that it represented. Various tourist attractions and landmarks such as the Hollywood Sign and the beaches were located less than an hour away from the park.\\n Fans criticized the Paradise Pier area of the park because many of the attractions in this area were generic rides that guests do not expect to find at a Disney park. This was ironic because Walt Disney originally created the neighboring Disneyland to provide a theme park experience unlike boardwalk piers and amusement parks of the era, and instead wanted to create a park where the entire family could enjoy themselves.\\n With an estimated price tag of $600 million, the park was criticized for being built \"on the cheap\", with a small number of attractions and minimal theming.\\n Many guests complained that a single day admission ticket to Disney\\'s California Adventure cost the same as a single day admission ticket to Disneyland, yet contained fewer attractions, shows, and entertainment.\\n\\nDisney\\'s chief executive officer, Robert Iger, went on record during the company\\'s annual stockholder meeting on March 10, 2006, when someone asked about a potential third park being built in Anaheim. \"We\\'re still working to assure the second gate is successful\", Iger said, referring to California Adventure. \"In the spirit of candor, we have been challenged.\"\\n\\nOn October 17, 2007, The Walt Disney Company announced a multi-year, $1.1 billion expansion plan for Disney\\'s California Adventure Park. Plans for the renovation and expansion were put on display for park visitors inside the Blue Sky Cellar at the Golden Vine Winery. Disney listened to the public and several of the attractions which drew criticism from the public were removed in the multi-year, multibillion-dollar redesign and expansion of Disney\\'s California Adventure. Other rides were redesigned or replaced with a larger focus on Disney characters and stories. \\n\\nOn May 28, 2010, it was announced through the Disney Parks Blog that the park would also be receiving a name change, to Disney California Adventure, as well as a new logo. The new name took effect on June 11, 2010, appearing on park maps and banners, but it was first used in a commercial promoting Disney\\'s World of Color a few days prior. World of Color premiered on June 11, 2010, as part of Disney\\'s Summer Nighttastic.\\n\\nWalt Disney World Resort\\nDisney\\'s Animal Kingdom\\n\\nEven in the planning stages, various Florida based animal rights groups and PETA did not like the idea of Disney creating a theme park where animals were held in captivity. The groups protested, and PETA tried to convince travel agents not to book trips to the park. A few weeks before the park opened, a number of animals died due to accidents. The United States Department of Agriculture viewed most of the cases and found no violations of animal-welfare regulations. On opening day, the Orange County Sheriff\\'s office sent about 150 deputies in fear that there may be a large protest, but only 24 protesters showed up. The protest lasted two hours, and there were no arrests.\\n\\nOne year after the park opened, The Animal Rights Foundation of Florida complained that a New Year\\'s Eve fireworks show could upset the animals. A USDA inspector came to the park to find no problems with launching low-noise fireworks half a mile away.\\n\\nDisney\\'s Wide World of Sports Complex\\n\\nA former baseball umpire and an architect alleged that they approached The Walt Disney Company in 1987 with plans for a sports complex and that Wide World of Sports, which opened 10 years later, was heavily based on their designs. Disney claimed that, while the designs had some similarities, the complex was also similar to numerous other sporting facilities, and the concept of a sports park was too generic for any one group to claim ownership. The two men, represented in part by noted attorney Johnnie Cochran, sued Disney in Orange County civil court. In August 2000, a jury returned a verdict for the plaintiffs with damages in the amount of $240 million, a fraction of the $1.5 billion sought. Disney appealed the judgment, and settled out of court in September 2002 for undisclosed terms.\\n\\nWalt Disney World College Program\\nThe Walt Disney World College Program is a U.S. national internship program operated by The Walt Disney Company, located at the Walt Disney World Resort. The Walt Disney World College Program recruits students (18 years and older) and all majors for a semester-long paid internship program working at the Walt Disney World Resort.\\n\\nCritics argue that Disney is using the program as a source of cheap labor, as interns do the same work as veteran employees, but at a significantly lower pay rate. In late 2007, a permanent Cast Member ran for president of the local union in Orlando. Part of his platform intended to get rid of the Disney College Program, claiming that the program \"imports thousands of low-wage earners every year to work for Disney, depressing the local employment market and keeping wages down.\" Disney responded that the program is beneficial in the recruitment of cast members and that 8,000 workers out of 62,000 do not greatly impact operations. It has been criticized also for its lack of union representation and denial of insurance benefits by the company.\\n\\nReedy Creek Improvement District\\nThe Reedy Creek Improvement District is the immediate governing jurisdiction for the land of the Walt Disney World Resort. When initially planning the resort back in the 1960s, Walt Disney felt that it would be easier to carry out his proposals with more flexibility and independence with his own specialized, personalized government. Among his ideas for his Florida project was his \"Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow\", which was to be a real planned city that would have also been used as a test bed for new innovations for city living. After extensive lobbying, the Government of Florida passed legislation establishing this special government district. The District essentially gives the Disney Company the standard powers and autonomy of an incorporated city.\\n\\nAfter Disney died in 1966 before realizing his vision, the Disney Company board decided that it did not want to be in the business of running a city. Most of Walt\\'s ideas for his planned city were eventually abandoned, and thus the residential areas were never built, causing some to cry foul. Most notably, Richard Foglesong argues in his book Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando that Disney has abused its powers by remaining in complete control of the district and using its autonomy solely for commercial interests inside its self-contained resort instead of maintaining an actual city. And although Disney built an actual community, Celebration, Florida, on their property in the 1990s, it was later de-annexed from the District and the company\\'s control.\\n\\n Miscellaneous \\nIn 2017, The Walt Disney Company and two of its subsidiaries reached an agreement with the U.S. Department of Labor to pay $3.8M to 16,339 employees of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts U.S. Inc and Disney Vacation Club Management Corp. After Disney had started charging employees for their costumes, the income of many employees fell below the federal minimum wage. The resorts were also found to be in violation of overtime and payroll recordkeeping regulations.\\n\\nDisneyland Paris\\nIn May 1992, entertainment magazine The Hollywood Reporter reported that about 25% of Euro Disney\\'s workforce\\xa0– approximately 3,000 men and women\\xa0– had resigned their jobs due to unacceptable working conditions. It also reported that the park\\'s attendance was far behind expectations. Euro Disney S.C.A., the company that operates Disneyland Paris, responded in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, in which the company\\'s president, Robert Fitzpatrick, claimed that only 1,000 people had left their jobs.\\n\\nIn response to the financial situation, Fitzpatrick ordered that the Disney-MGM Studios Europe project would be put on hiatus until a further decision could be made. Prices at the resort\\'s hotels were also reduced significantly.\\n\\nDespite these efforts, in May 1992 daily park attendance was around 25,000 (some reports give a figure of 30,000) instead of the predicted 60,000. Euro Disney\\'s stock price spiraled downwards and on July 23, 1992, the Resort announced an expected net loss in its first year of operation of approximately 300 million French francs. During Euro Disney\\'s first winter, hotel occupancy was such that it was decided to close Disney\\'s Newport Bay Club hotel for the season. Initial hopes were that each visitor would spend around US$33 per day, but near the end of 1992, analysts reckoned spending to be around 12% lower.\\n\\nEfforts to improve attendance included serving alcoholic beverages with meals inside the Euro Disneyland theme park, in response to a presumed European demand, which began June 12, 1993.\\n\\nIn January 1994, Sanford Litvack, an attorney from New York City and former Assistant Attorney General during the Jimmy Carter presidency, was assigned to be Disney\\'s lead negotiator regarding Euro Disney\\'s future. On February 28, Litvack made an offer (without the consent of Eisner or Frank Wells) to split the debts between Euro Disney creditors and Disney. After the banks showed interest, Litvack informed Eisner and Wells. On March 14, the day before the annual shareholders meeting, the banks capitulated to Disney\\'s demands. The creditor banks bought US$500 million worth of Euro Disney shares, forgave 18 months of interest and deferred interest payments for three years. The Walt Disney Company invested US$750 million into Euro Disney and granted a five-year suspension of royalty payments. In June that same year, Saudi Arabian Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal Bin Abdulaziz Al Saud cut a deal whereby The Walt Disney Company bought 51% of a new US$1.1 billion share issue, the rest being offered to existing shareholders at below-market rates, with the Prince buying any that were not taken up by existing shareholders (up to a 24.5% holding).  Prince Al-Waleed Bin Talal was alleged to be a financier of Al Qaeda by The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, also known as the 9/11 Commission.\\n\\nWalt Disney Studios Park, which was built in a desperate and rushed attempt to increase the resort\\'s attendance, was also criticized for its lackluster theming, lack of quality attractions and bland environment since its opening. It was also Disney\\'s smallest and least attended theme park. Efforts made to improve the park included the addition of several new attractions, a new themed land Toy Story Playland and re-theming of other areas. One of the new attractions, Crush\\'s Coaster, was also criticized for its long lines and wait times reaching up to two hours even on non-crowded days due to its popularity, despite being not capable of handling riders at a fast rate. About one hour before the official opening time of the park, guests were able to enter the park to wait in line for the ride, which had not been done before in any other Disney ride. Attempts to apply a Fastpass line in the ride have been proved to be more inefficient.\\n\\nHong Kong Disneyland Resort\\n\\nOvercrowding problems\\nJust before the grand opening, the park was criticized for underestimating the daily capacity limit.  The problem became apparent on the charity preview day on September 4, 2005, when 30,000 locals visited the park. This event turned out to be a disaster, because there were too many guests for the park to accommodate. Wait times at fast food outlets were at least 45 minutes in length, and wait times at rides were two hours in length.\\n\\nAlthough the community, and the park\\'s biggest shareholder, the Hong Kong government, put pressure on the park to lower the capacity, the park insisted on keeping the limit and only agreed to relieve the capacity problem by extending the opening time by one hour or introducing more discounts during weekdays. However, the park said that local visitors tend to stay in the park for about nine hours per visit, implying that the mentioned practices would do little to solve the problem.\\n\\nDuring the Chinese New Year 2006, many visitors arrived at the park in the morning bearing valid tickets but were refused entry, because the park was already at capacity. Disgruntled visitors attempted to force their way into the park or gain access by climbing over the barrier gates. Disneyland management was forced to revise their ticketing policy and designated future periods close to Chinese public holidays as \\'special days\\' during which admission would only be allowed through a date-specific ticket.\\n\\nFood safety panel\\nOfficers from the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department, who were asked by Disney staff to take off their badges and caps in order to enter the park, left park visitors feeling very uneasy. The officers investigated a food-poisoning case in the park\\'s restaurants. The chairman of Legco\\'s food Safety panel, Fred Li, described the incident as shocking and called on the director of the department to take follow-up action against Disney. Hong Kong Disneyland says that what happened was inappropriate and has apologized for the incident. The Secretary for Justice has since said that the government did not have enough evidence to make a prosecution, thus dropping the case.\\n\\nFingerprinting\\nAs at other Disney theme parks, visitors to Hong Kong Disneyland have their finger biometrics scanned at the entry gate. Visitors are not warned of the policy beforehand. Scanning is done of all visitors older than 10 years of age, and is used to associate ticket media with the person using it. The company claims that \"the 50 sample points from the surface of a guest\\'s finger ... do not contain sufficient information to recreate a fingerprint image.\" Nonetheless, forensic specialists note that the data collected are more than adequate to establish a positive identification.\\n\\nShark fin soup controversy\\nDisney originally planned to serve shark fin soup, a traditional Chinese delicacy, at wedding banquets. Animal rights groups protested in June 2005, citing the declining shark population in global waters and the cruel methods sometimes used of cutting the fin and discarding live sharks back into the sea.\\n\\nAt first, Disney removed shark fin soup from its menu, but said that it would still offer the soup if their clients insisted on having it served at their wedding. They said they would distribute leaflets about shark conservation in order to discourage the choice.\\n\\nHowever, after constant and continuous pressure from both environmental groups and animal welfare groups, shareholders concerned about the company\\'s image, Disney announced on June 24, 2005 that shark fin soup will not be served at all, because, according to their press release, \"After careful consideration and a thorough review process, we were not able to identify an environmentally sustainable fishing source, leaving us no alternative except to remove shark fin soup from our wedding banquet menu\".\\n\\nOther controversies\\nFish around Ma Wan died as a result of land reclamation.\\n\\nDisney\\'s PhotoPass\\nDisney\\'s PhotoPass is a professional photography service offered at Disney theme parks, water parks, and resorts. Photographers positioned at locations in the theme parks, dining events at the resorts, and at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique at Downtown Disney are linked to a free card containing a unique serial number. Guests can view or purchase PhotoPass pictures at locations in the parks (generally near the park entrance) or online by registering the card\\'s number.\\n\\nCustomers have complained about the difference in advertised prices, particularly of Photo CD products, and the actual cost. Disney has responded that advertised specials apply only to products purchased at the parks and do not apply to the website.\\n\\nDisney Consumer Products\\nDisney Princess\\nOn December 24, 2006, Peggy Orenstein published \"What\\'s Wrong With Cinderella?\" in The New York Times. In her article, Orenstein discussed her concerns about the effects of princess figures on young girls. Orenstein used the Disney Princesses specifically to present many of her points. Orenstein also noted the pervasive nature of princess-related merchandise and that every facet of play has its princess equivalent.\\n\\nOther sources have also voiced concern that the franchise could possibly give young girls the wrong message. However, other parents who have young daughters say that they would eventually grow out of this phase.\\n\\nMarvel Comics\\nPage 16 of Captain America #602 (March 2010) depicted an anti-tax protest march in Idaho in which one participant held a sign reading \"Tea Bag the Libs Before They Tea Bag You\", with a caption containing the words of an off-screen African-American superhero, the Falcon, telling Captain America, \"I don\\'t exactly see a black man from Harlem fitting in with a bunch of angry white folks.\" The cartoon drew the condemnation of Michael Johns, a board member of the Nationwide Tea Party Coalition. \\n\\nMarvel Comics Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada characterized the sign as inadvertent and as \"something that we need to apologize for and own up to....\" Quesada explained that with a printing deadline looming, the comic\\'s editor noticed that the protest group\\'s signs on the original art were empty, and the editor \"asked the letterer on the book to just fudge in some quick signs. The letterer in his rush ... looked on the \\'net and started pulling slogans from actual signs\", including a \"Tea Bag\" sign. \\n\\nFollowing the issue\\'s printing, Marvel staff \"caught the mistake\" and \"spoke to the letterer, [who] was mortified at his mistake and was truly sorry as he had no political agenda.\" Quesada said Marvel \"removed the sign from the art files so that it no longer appears in future reprints of the title or collections. So, while the crowd protesting has nothing to do with the villains in the story, we in no way meant to say they were associated with the Tea Party movement....\"\\n\\nTransition of ownership regarding Star Wars\\nOn December 21, 2012, Disney acquired Lucasfilm (and as a result, the rights to the Star Wars franchise; Skywalker Sound; and Industrial Light and Magic) as a subsidiary for the price of $4 billion. Lucasfilm and Star Wars in general were evaluated to decide upon how each area was to be approached. \\n\\nAfter Dark Horse Comics lost the rights to create Star Wars comics, Marvel Comics gained the rights as a subsidiary in the area of expertise. The way the movies are being handled is still in flux with possible spin-offs in talks as well as the planned new trilogy. The decisions regarding the other sectors like games, books and animated media can be interpreted as anti-consumer. \\n\\nWith the elimination of the LucasArts developing arm, EA Games is being entrusted to make Star Wars video games in the future. The well-regarded animated TV series Star Wars: The Clone Wars was cancelled a few seasons from the end of its run, in order to shift the series\\' team to Star Wars Rebels, a new animated TV series created for Disney XD, set approximately five years before the events of Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope. This was done in the knowledge that many people loved the series and that it was quite profitable. They eventually revived Clone Wars for a final season.\\n\\nFurthermore, book consumers were not given the option of two universes to read from, the first of which is what many of them have been reading about for over 40 years and have grown to love and the second of which is Disney\\'s attempt to unify things under one controllable banner; as a result, this left fans of these books to only read new entries in the Unified Canon, and if they wish to see the continued growth of the Star Wars universe, the previous universe is now stuck in limbo.\\n\\nOn June 20, 2017, Phil Lord and Chris Miller, the directors of the film Solo: A Star Wars Story, left the production of the film five weeks before filming ended. Lord and Miller cited \"creative differences\" for their reason to part ways with the film. Many compared this to Edgar Wright stepping down as director of Ant-Man due to creative differences with Marvel Studios. Three months later, Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow stepped down as director under similar circumstances and was replaced with Star Wars: The Force Awakens director J. J. Abrams.\\n\\n Sweatshop controversies \\nIn 1996, the New York-based National Labor Committee released a 12-page report that severely criticized Sears, Walmart, and The Walt Disney Company. Haitian contractors producing Mickey Mouse and Pocahontas pajamas for U.S. companies under license with the Walt Disney Corporation are in some cases paying workers as little as 15 gourdes (US$1) per day\\xa0– 12 cents an hour\\xa0– in clear violation of Haitian law, said the NLC. One factory owner testified that workers underperform because they cannot eat enough. Besides living on starvation wages, Haitian factory workers have to deal with sexual harassment and extraordinarily long working days. The report claimed it would take on seamstress 1,040 years to earn what, then CEO, Michael Eisner earned in one day.\\n\\nIn 2012, the Institute for Global Labour and Human Rights released the report \"Toys From Hell\". It describes how workers at Dream International factory in Shenzen, China work 117 hours weeks, in a filthy and unhealthy environment, where they are constantly screamed at by supervisors and only earns $1.39 per hour. They\\'re also expected to lodge in filthy and overcrowded dormitories, where they are served below par food. Additionally, the Dream International factory is considered to be a fire hazard.\\n\\n Cruelty to animals \\nIt has been criticized by animal welfare groups for their care of, and procedures for, wild animals at Disney\\'s Animal Kingdom theme park. \\n\\nIn 1989, Disney was charged with sixteen state and federal counts of animal cruelty relating to the abuse of vultures and other birds at its Discovery Island zoological park. According to investigators, employees shot at hawks, clubbed vultures to death with a stick, and destroyed nests and eggs. The park\\'s supervisor supposedly sanctioned the abuses. Most striking were the deaths of fifteen vultures crammed into a tiny, overheated shed for days with limited food and water. Authorities also discovered 72 vultures confined in a windowless, airless shed, which legally speaking was only big enough for three vultures. Disney made a deal and in exchange for the dismissal of three federal charges, it pleaded guilty to a simple misdemeanor and agreed to pay a total of $95,000 to various institutions.\\n\\nDisney has been criticized for using purebred dogs in movies such as 101 Dalmatians.  Animal rights groups claim movies with purebreds create an artificial demand for purebreds from people who may not be prepared or temperamentally suited for the animals, many of whom end up abandoned or surrendered to animal shelters or rescue groups.\\n\\nAcquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney\\n\\nOn December 14, 2017, Disney agreed to acquire 21st Century Fox\\'s motion picture business, cable and direct satellite entertainment networks, that was completed on March 20, 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, Disney acquired the 20th Century Fox film and TV studios and related assets; cable and satellite networks including FX Networks, Fox Networks Group; Indian TV broadcasting company Star India; stakes in National Geographic Partners and Hulu, and other assets. Prior to the completion of the deal, Fox spun-off its news and broadcast businesses, including Fox News, Fox Business, FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes, and the Big Ten Network, the Fox Broadcasting Company, and MyNetworkTV into the newly-formed Fox Corporation.\\n\\nThis merger was subject to widespread criticism among critics, consumers, and businesses due to antitrust concerns. One of the biggest concerns is that unlike Disney\\'s acquisition of Pixar, Marvel Entertainment, and Lucasfilm, the Disney/Fox deal was a horizontal integration (in which a company owns a direct competitor) in contrast to a vertical integration (in which two companies operate different stages for a specific finished product) like the mergers of AT&T-Time Warner and Comcast-NBCUniversal. Given Disney\\'s already powerful box market shares, a combined Disney/Fox would give it a 39% theatrical market share and would strengthen Disney\\'s already leveraging power over theater owners in its favor without regard to the negative effects on their businesses.\\n\\nSouth Park controversy\\n\\nThe Jonas Brothers and Disney Channel are parodied in the South Park episode entitled \"The Ring\" and play a prominent role in the episode\\'s plot. In a television column written before \"The Ring\" aired, Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post suggested that creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were using the Jonas Brothers in the 13th season debut as a means of improving the show\\'s ratings; Comedy Central executives, however, insisted that the Jonas Brothers fans do not fit into South Park\\'\\'\\'s demographic of males aged from 18 to 49. \\n\\nThe Walt Disney Company, Disney Channel and the Mickey Mouse cartoon character are also prominently featured and spoofed in the episode; even when Mickey Mouse says callous things or physically assaults people, he follows up most statements with the character\\'s trademark high-pitched \"Ha ha!\" laugh, which in context comes off like a nervous tic.\\n\\nReviewers and commentators have described \"The Ring\" as not just a parody of the Jonas Brothers, but also of the ethos of The Walt Disney Company. The episode portrays Disney as a corporation using the ruse of family-friendly morals to disguise their primary motive, which is profit; reviewers and articles said this point is further illustrated by the use of Mickey Mouse, a cartoon symbol for the wholesome Disney image, as a foul-mouthed, contemptuous, greedy, all-powerful and violent character. \\n\\nSpecifically, the episode targets Disney\\'s marketing tactic of the band members pledging abstinence through purity rings, which the script suggests is used to subliminally sell sex to young girls, while simultaneously appeasing their parents\\' ethical standards and taking advantage of their fearful desire to protect their daughters, as Mickey had said.\\n\\nDue to other speculation on the orientation and personal activities of the Jonas brothers, the episode continued to create a running gag on the effect of the Jonas brothers on young girls of the \"tween\" period, often provoking the image that they too would become like Mickey Mouse, in most unwanted characteristics. The episode further illustrates the greed of corporate culture by portraying Mickey as capitalizing on religion for profit, while secretly mocking it in a particularly cruel tone: \"Even the Christians are too fucking stupid to figure out I\\'m selling sex to their daughters! I\\'ve made billions off of Christian ignorance for decades now! And do you know why? Because Christians are retarded! They believe in a talking dead guy!\"\\n\\nCollusion to replace employees with H-1B holders\\nIn January 2016, lawsuits were filed against Disney, HCL Technologies and Cognizant alleging the companies colluded to bring in holders of H-1B visas to replace American workers thereby breaking the law. The lawsuits were filed by two former employees who filed a separate but similar complaint both seeking class-action status. This is the first lawsuit filed against both the former employer and the outsourcing companies, alleging that the companies involved collaborated intentionally to displace Americans and replace them with foreign workers. In October 2016, federal Judge Gregory A. Presnell of the United States District Court in Orlando dismissed the lawsuits, stating: \"none of the allegedly false statements put at issue in the complaint are adequate\".\\n\\nCopyright extension\\nSince 1990, The Walt Disney Company has lobbied for copyright extension. The Copyright Term Extension Act delayed the entry into the public domain of the earliest Mickey Mouse movies, leading detractors to nickname it \"The Mickey Mouse Protection Act\". Opponents of the legislation consider it to be corporate welfare and have tried (but failed) to have it declared unconstitutional, claiming that such an act is not \"necessary and proper\" to accomplishing the Constitution\\'s stated purpose of \"promot[ing] the progress of science and useful arts\". They argue that most works bring most of the profits during the first few years and are pushed off the market by the publishers thereafter. Thus there is a little economic incentive in extending the terms of copyrights except for the few owners of franchises that are wildly successful, such as Disney.\\n\\n Miscellaneous criticisms and complaints \\n In November 2020, Alan Dean Foster, an author who wrote several novelizations of Star Wars, said that Disney was refusing to pay royalties on the novels, or even recognize that contractual obligations existed. Disney was censured by the president of the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America, Mary Robinette Kowal, as well as other prominent authors.\\n In August 2014, Disney and Disney English were sued in an American court for subjecting workers, young children and infants to highly polluted air in classrooms, resulting in illness. Disney chose to settle out of court.\\n Religious welfare groups such as the Catholic League have spoken out against the release of material which they and others found offensive, including vehement protests of the Miramax Films features Priest (1994) and Dogma (1999). Disney pushed back Dogmas release date due to the controversy surrounding the movie, and eventually sold the distribution rights to Lions Gate Films.  The ABC show Nothing Sacred, about a Jesuit priest, a book called Growing Up Gay (published by Disney-owned Hyperion Press), the (unofficial) annual Gay and Lesbian Days at Disney theme parks, and similar issues spurred boycotts of Disney and its advertisers by the Catholic League, the Assemblies of God, and other conservative Christian groups.\\n The company has been accused of human rights violations regarding the working conditions in factories that produce their merchandise. \\n The Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) and the American Family Association voted to boycott Disney over opposition to Disney offering domestic partnership benefits to gay employees and over opposition to the ABC show Ellen, in which the show\\'s star, Ellen DeGeneres, came out as lesbian. Both boycotts were withdrawn in 2005.\\n An environmental management plan for a zone of Great Guana Cay, in the Abaco Islands, criticized Disney for poor management of a  tract of the island. Disney partially developed but then abandoned the place, which was to have been a cruise ship resort called Treasure Island. The report, by the University of Miami and the College of the Bahamas, blames Disney for leaving hazardous materials, electrical transformers, and fuel tanks, as well as introducing invasive alien plants and insects that threaten the island\\'s natural flora and fauna.\\n Disney Publishing Worldwide supported the widely criticized Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA).\\n\\nSee also \\n\\n Criticism of ESPN\\n Incidents at Disney Parks\\n Walt Disney: Hollywood\\'s Dark Prince\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nDisney\\nThe Walt Disney Company\\n \\nLGBT-related controversies\\nRace-related controversies\\nAnimation controversies\\nMass media and entertainment controversies\\nMass media-related controversies in the United States', 'The first 100 days of Imran Khan\\'s prime ministership began with his swearing-in ceremony on 18 August 2018 as the 22nd Prime Minister of Pakistan – shortly after the oath-taking of the 15th National Assembly of Pakistan on 13 August, and the elected parliament\\'s vote of confidence for Khan\\'s premiership on 17 August. The 100th day of his prime ministership was 25 November 2018.\\n\\nThe first 100 days of his premiership took on symbolic significance after his party had announced a \"100-day agenda\" months before the 2018 Pakistani general election. According to both government sources and outside observers, this period is considered a benchmark to measure the early success of his government and will lay the platform for the coming five years.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nJust a few days before the elections were announced, his party unveiled the first 100 days plan for his future government. The plan included the creation of a new province in Southern Punjab, reconciliation with alienated Baloch leaders, development of Karachi, poverty alleviation, and betterment of the economy overall. The plan included a jumbo development package for FATA to which other provinces will contribute three per cent of their share. The newly created province in Southern Punjab would be given complete autonomy, made an agricultural hub, an economic package would be announced, and the young will be provided with job opportunities by setting up a food processing industry. The promise was made to implement the job quota reserved for Balochistan. The federal government would announce a development package for Karachi after the completion of six-point agenda, which includes betterment of law and order, strengthening of local government, operations against extortionists and China cutting mafia, a housing infrastructure plan, setup of a public transport system, and culmination of militant sections of political parties. To improve the overall economy of the country, it was promised that 10 million jobs will be created, the manufacturing sector will be resuscitated, small and medium-sized businesses will be developed fast, and the private sector will be assisted in building five million houses. Reformation of tax administration, increase in tourism, the transformation of state-owned enterprises, and overcoming of the energy challenges was also promised. Improvement of the agriculture sector was promised through increasing profitability and access to finance for farmers.  Farmers will also be provided value-added incentives, livestock sector, and produce markets will be improved. National Water Policy will be improved and acted upon. Through this plan, it was promised that national security would be revamped by creation of four national security organizations.\\n\\nInaugural address\\nOn 19 August 2018, he addressed the nation formally on television otherwise referred to as his formal inaugural address in which he laid out the basis of his policies and agenda for his government. In that address, he announced many austerity measures which included reduction of PM house employees and bulletproof vehicles, conversion of PM house into a university, conversion of governor houses into public benefit buildings, and criticism on foreign visits of prime minister (which was taken as an indication that he will reduce them). He showed concern about how the nation\\'s children were having stunted growth due to malnutrition while the government is spending an extensive amount of money on its own luxuries. Khan announced that he will not live in Prime Minister House and will cut down the staff of prime minister house from 524 people to 2 people. He also announced that he will only keep two vehicles out of the current 80 vehicles available for use by Prime Minister and the rest will be auctioned. He said he will not own any business while in office so that there is no conflict of interest. He also promised to strengthen the Zakat system. He announced that his government will take measures to increase exports. He also announced that he will be ashamed to ask for monetary help from other nations and rather would adopt austerity measures to get rid of the debt. He announced to strengthen the tax collection system. He requested overseas Pakistani to help Pakistan in this time of great need by keeping money in Pakistani banks and by sending money by banks instead of by illegal means. Explaining the reason to keep interior ministry to himself he said he wanted to keep Federal Investigation Agency directly under himself so he can oversee the efforts to curtail money laundering. He announced to the creation of a task force to bring laundered money back to Pakistan. He offered National Accountability Bureau, the help of the federal government to curtail the corruption. He announced to form a task force to improve government hospitals so poor people of the country can get the same high-quality care as rich who opt to get health care in private hospitals. He also touched upon how Pakistani children are having stunted growth due to malnutrition.\\n\\nHe said there is a crisis of water in major cities and we will work on completing Diamer-Bhasha Dam to combat that crisis and we will help farmers on methods to save water during irrigation. He announced that we will not invite people from other countries to take care of sanitation needs rather we will create our own sanitation system. He gave the example of the state of Medina and how educated prisoners of war were given incentives upon teaching an uneducated person. He also announced to convert PM House into a world-class research university where he would invite scholars from around the world to do research on different subjects. He announced that he will improve the government school system so people do not have to opt for private schools to give quality education to their children. He also said that the madrassah system will be brought at par with the rest of the education system so it can produce quality citizens. On foreign policy, he announced in his inaugural address to the nation that we want peace with all the nations in the world. He announced that his government will create initiatives to plant billions of trees to combat global warming and heatwaves. He announced that we will build parks and playgrounds. He promised to build four tourism sites every year for the development of tourism. He also promised to develop international standard beaches. Khan said that he specifically tasked his human rights ministry to work towards ending sexual abuse towards children. He stressed the creation of a new province in Southern Punjab. Giving an example of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\\'s former government, he announced that the police system would be reformed in Punjab and Balochistan in a similar manner and they would request the Sindh government to do the same. He said that he would have a meeting with Chief Justice of Pakistan and together they would reform the judicial system so that every case would be decided in less than one year time. He asked civil service to provide services to the common man with respect as they have the right to those services. He announced to create a new local government system and not provide development funds to members of parliament. He addressed the nation formally on television otherwise referred to as his formal inaugural address in which he laid out the basis of his policies and agenda for his government. Khan announced that he will appoint Nasir Durrani as an advisor in Punjab Government so that he can bring same reform in Punjab Police as he did in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa as Inspector General of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Police.\\n\\nBuilding the team\\n\\nKhan announced most of his team at national and provincial levels before he took oath as prime minister but some of his nominees were confirmed later either by a vote or by mere taking an oath of their concerned office. On 18 August 2018, after taking oath as prime minister of Pakistan, Khan announced his 21-member federal cabinet and their portfolios. He appointed Mohammad Azam Khan as his secretary. The same day, he nominated Arif Alvi for the office of President of Pakistan. On 19 August 2018, His nominee Sardar Usman Buzdar, a political candidate belonging to the rural area of Dera Ghazi Khan, was elected as Punjab Chief Minister despite criticism, mainly due to his less prominent background and allegations of a criminal case against him in 1998. Khan and the PTI justified Buzdar\\'s selection, stating the party conducted background checks and found him to be honest, adding that the previous case against him was politically motivated; according to Khan, Buzdar belonged to an impoverished district with \"no water, electricity or hospital\" and that he would be \"well acquainted with how people live in those areas, and secondly, he is aware of how the poor lead their lives. When he will assume the office of the chief minister he will know the nature of the plight that faces the underprivileged people of Pakistan\". On 20 August 2018, His cabinet took the oath of office. Khan appointed former official of NAB Mirza Shehzad Akbar as his special assistant for accountability. The PTI\\'s chief whip, Shireen Mazari, was given the portfolio of human rights ministry.\\n\\nKhan nominated Ehsan Mani as Pakistan Cricket Board chairman after Najam Sethi resigned. On 22 August 2018, two new special assistance to prime minister were inducted including Iftikhar Durrani on media affairs and Naeemul Haque on political affairs. On 25 August 2018, Khan nominated Ehsan Mani and Asad Ali Khan as members of Board of Governors of Pakistan Cricket Board. He gave his consent to the nomination of Ameer Muhammad Khan Jogezai as Governor of Balochistan. Shibli Faraz was nominated leader of the house for the Senate of Pakistan. Khan approved the appointment of former counsel for Pervez Musharraf, Anwar Mansoor Khan as Attorney General of Pakistan. On 26 August 2018, prime minister\\'s office backtracked on the decision to make Ameer Muhammad Khan Jogezai as governor of Balochistan saying that the name was discussed but never finalized. A 23-member Punjab cabinet and a 15-member Khyber Pakhtunkhwa cabinet was formed with full approval by Khan. On 27 August 2018, Khan appointed finance minister Asad Umar as the boss of forthcoming Economic Coordination Committee. On 28 August 2018, Khan decided to appoint Shehryar Khan Afridi as minister of the state for interior. Same day, Khan also made some appointments in bureaucracy, he appointed Muhammad Suleman Khan as Director General Intelligence Bureau. Jahanzeb Khan was appointed as Chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue. Mehr Khaliq Dad Lak was appointed as Director-General of National Counter Terrorism Authority. On 1 September 2018, Khan formed an 18-member Economic Advisory Council (EAC) to advise on matters of economic policymaking. The council includes financial experts associated with international universities such as Atif Mian from Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, Asim Ijaz Khawaja from John F. Kennedy School of Government, and Imran Rasul from University College London.\\n\\nOn 4 September 2018, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\\'s presidential candidate, Arif Alvi, was elected as the 13th President of Pakistan following the 2018 presidential election scheduled on 4 September. He received 352 votes and defeated opposition candidates Fazal-ur-Rehman and Aitzaz Ahsan who secured 184 and 124 votes, respectively. Polling was held via the Electoral College of Pakistan, which comprised the National Assembly, Senate, and the four provincial assemblies of Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan; all elected members of the respective houses cast secret ballot voting for their preferred candidate. Khan\\'s advisor and legal aide Babar Awan voluntarily tendered his resignation from the ministry of parliamentary affairs, following a corruption case filed against him by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) over alleged irregularities in the Nandipur Power Project, when Awan had been affiliated with the ruling PPP government from 2008 to 2013 as federal law minister. Explaining his resignation, Awan tweeted: \"Rule of law begins with me. Thank you, Insafians for standing by me always. I will never let you down.\" Information minister Fawad Chaudhry defended Atif Mian\\'s appointment to the Economic Advisory Council, following a vicious smear campaign against the latter on social media targeting him for his Ahmadi faith. Lambasting the controversy, Chaudhry stated: \"Pakistan belongs as much to minorities as it does to the majority. I don\\'t think anyone should have objections [to Mian\\'s appointment], and those who do, they are basically extremists and we will not bow to extremists\", later tweeting: \"...we\\'ll follow [the] principles of Mr Jinnah, not of extremists\". Continuing his defense of Atif Mian\\'s appointment in the EAC, Fawad Chaudhry stated: \"Protecting minorities is our responsibility. It is the religious duty of each Muslim, not just the government, to protect minorities and respect those that they live with\". On 7 September however, it was learnt that the government had relented and asked Atif to step down, who voluntarily offered to commit out of the EAC and would be replaced. According to senator Faisal Javed, the government did not aim to deliberately create social division based on such issues and said the government aimed to \"move forward alongside scholars and all social groups, and it is inappropriate if a single nomination creates an impression to the contrary\". The development was roundly condemned by critics, especially those belonging to the liberal sections of society. In solidarity with Mian, two overseas-based economists in the EAC, Asim Khwaja and Imran Rasul, announced they were resigning from the committee with a decision which was \"painful\" and \"heavy-hearted\" respectively; both wished the new government well, and said they would always be willing to assist Pakistan in their individual capacities. Meanwhile, on 8 September, Fazl-ur-Rehman, leader of the right-wing opposition party JUI-F, castigated the government for appointing Mian and alleged that by selecting an Ahmadi from the West, Khan was actually seeking to \"influence our economy with Jewish ways\" and on the \"dictates of the West\". An article on Dawn dated 10 September stated the actual reason behind Mian\\'s removal lay in \"internal dissent\" from religious parties who had threatened nationwide sit-ins against the appointment, on the same day that Chinese and Saudi dignitaries were to arrive in Islamabad. Sources said the government had been compelled to take the decision to avoid an \\'ugly\\' situation during the foreign dignitaries\\' visits, as well as due to political pressure and nitpicking by some opposition parties. A PTI member described the situation as \"unfortunate\" and said some cabinet members felt \"depressed\" after the EAC lost three of its top thinkers, even while replacement slots were being filled.\\n\\nOn 4 September 2018, Khan\\'s pick for the chairmanship of Pakistan Cricket Board, Ehsan Mani was elected as such by the board. On 5 September 2018, Khan\\'s nomination for governorship of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Shah Farman took oath of office.\\n\\nOn 8 September, it was learnt that the PTI\\'s Punjab government had inducted nine more ministers, three extra advisers and five special attendants; the federal government meanwhile announced it was expanding the cabinet and adding four more ministers, who were to take oath on 10 September: Omar Ayub Khan (energy portfolio), Ali Zaidi (maritime affairs portfolio), Muhammad Mian Soomro (privatisation portfolio) and Murad Saeed, whose post was still undetermined. This brought the number of total federal cabinet members to 24. That same day, Mamnoon Hussain completed his tenure in office as President of Pakistan and exited the President House with a guard of honour. He would be succeeded by president-elect Arif Alvi of the PTI, who won the 2018 presidential election days back and was slated to take office on 9 September 2018.\\n\\nEconomic, anti-corruption, and austerity measures\\nOn 20 August 2018, Khan\\'s cabinet minister Shafqat Mahmood made a committee to counsel on forthcoming community consumption of \"heritage buildings\" which include governor houses around the country among others. Same day, Khan\\'s finance minister Asad Umar said that Khan had ordered him to bring back the laundered money from oversees. Umar also said that workers of Pakistan International Airlines and Pakistan Steel Mills will not be sacked as those people have nothing to do with these organizations being in financial loss. He said that government will sell bonds to expatriate Pakistanis. As part of anti-corruption measures, his cabinet decided to put Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz on exit control list so they cannot leave the country. The cabinet also issued a directive to bring back Ishaq Dar and sons of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif - Hussain and Hassan - to face justice in pending cases against them. The cabinet also decided to implement the austerity measures announced in Khan\\'s inaugural speech. It was decided that employees released from the prime minister house would be adjusted elsewhere.

Khan has instructed his ministers to work fourteen hours per day while he himself will work sixteen hours per day, he also instructed them to not take any holiday for the first three months (a little short of 100 days) including Sundays. The cabinet also decided to discontinue the overseas medical facilities for ministers which are usually funded by the government treasury. It also decided to auction the bulletproof and extravagant vehicles belonging to the prime minister house. The decision was made to avoid unnecessary international tours by government officials including the prime minister, to that effect foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi will attend the annual United Nations General Assembly session in September 2018 instead of Khan. On 21 August 2018, the announcement made by the cabinet regarding putting Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz on exit control list was acted upon.\\n\\nAsad Qaiser, Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan announced to follow strict austerity measures in parliament. On 21 August 2018, after reviewing a ten year report of Capital Development Authority (CDA), Khan announced that he will act towards ending corruption in CDA, he also issued directive to solve water crisis in Islamabad. Same day, the announcement made by the cabinet on 20 August 2018 regarding putting Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz on exit control list was acted upon. The cabinet decided to eliminate discretionary funds for members of parliament including ministers and the prime minister but in reality, these funds were already abolished by the previous government of Pakistan Muslim League (N). The cabinet also decided that no announcements of projects of public benefit will be made during public rallies like previous prime ministers used to do. Khan will not use a special plane for international visits and the benefit of travel via first-class has been taken away from ministers, the prime minister, the president, and the chief justice of Pakistan, all will travel via club class. A forensic audit of major mass transport systems in the country will be conducted. Khan instructed Chief Minister of Punjab, Sardar Usman Buzdar to keep the cabinet small. On 24 August, the government launched a probe to audit all metro bus projects initiated by the previous PML-N government, including the established metros in Lahore, Islamabad and Multan, the upcoming Green Line of Karachi, and the Orange Line train of Lahore; the objective was to evaluate the transparency of the projects, the contracts allotted to companies, and the spending of funds.

Aleem Khan, the provincial minister and close associate of prime minister announced that he will donate his monthly salary to Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital during his tenure as the minister. He also announced that he will not be running his business while he is in government and will only use his personal vehicle for his governmental land travel needs. On 28 August 2018, in a twist about a controversy regarding Khan not following his own announced austerity measures by using a helicopter for his daily travel between prime minister house and his Bani Gala residence, his information minister Fawad Chaudhry explained that the travel by helicopter costs 50 rupees per kilometre. He said that this cost is based on his Google Search about prime minister\\'s travel by helicopter. Chaudhry\\'s claim became a laughing stock on social media. Khan spent the weekdays at the Prime Minister\\'s secretariat, while his weekends were spent at his Bani Gala residence.\\n\\nOn 28 August, finance minister Asad Umar stated that the government was weighing its options, but had not decided yet on whether it would seek a fresh bailout package from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), keeping in view the ongoing economic situation of the country. He informed the Senate that Pakistan had gone to the IMF 12 times previously, and said that the government\\'s real fight was with unemployment and inflation.

Same day, the cabinet tasked the advisor for austerity to present government reforms within ninety days. On 29 August 2018, the prime minister had a meeting with National Accountability Bureau Chairman during which he ensured government\\'s unflinching support to strengthen the bureau further and praised its performance. The meeting drew criticism due to the conflict of interest as the same bureau was investigating helicopter misuse case against the prime minister and corruption cases against cabinet member Pervez Khattak. On 31 August 2018, Khan\\'s government announced its first reduction in petroleum prices. The price of petrol, high-speed diesel, kerosene oil, and light diesel was reduced by 2.41, 6.37, .46, and .59 rupees accordingly. On 1 September 2018, going ahead with austerity measures announced by Khan, the prime minister house set the date for the auction of a total of 102 luxury vehicles including 27 bullet-proof vehicles.

On 3 September 2018, in a top-level meeting, Khan directed government departments to take proactive measures in preventing money laundering and smuggling across the country through unconventional, illegal methods such as hawala and hundi. He reviewed a presentation from the Federal Board of Revenue on losses incurred to the economy as a result of illegal financial transactions. A committee was constituted to make existing financial laws stronger, and propose amendments to these laws where required, the findings of which would be presented in a week. On 4 September 2018, Khan asked the petroleum division to make a plan for stopping the stealing of gas and ordered a 46% increase in natural gas rates as devised by Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority. The decision was criticised particularly due to its impact on gas bills for consumers, but other analysts said it was necessary given the pressure faced by the government over existing subsidies to the gas sector. On 5 September 2018, the cabinet held a meeting, during which it was decided that efforts would be made to recover money illegally stashed abroad by Pakistanis, mainly due to corruption. Khan was in the process of ratifying a treaty with Swiss authorities to exchange information of Pakistani-owned bank accounts there. A whistleblowers\\' law would be enacted whereby individuals and firms who helped in trailing and recovering illegal money abroad would be awarded 20 per cent of the recovered amount.

According to an official, profit rates are reviewed by the finance ministry based on current interest rates and the profit rates on government-related securities such as treasury bills and the Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB).\\n\\nOn 7 September 2018, a petition was filed in Islamabad High Court asking to stop the auction to sell prime minister house vehicles as those vehicles are used by foreign dignitaries. If the vehicles are sold, the prime minister house will have to rent similar vehicles in case of visits by foreign dignitaries and it will be expensive for the exchequer. The petitioner also maintained that there was Rs80 million spent on the auction advertisement. Finance Minister Asad Umar said the government wanted to boost exports, and in this regard complete support would be provided to export-based industries including textiles, during a meeting in Islamabad with All Pakistan Textile Mills Association, also attended by the government\\'s textile and industry advisor, Abdul Razak Dawood. Also discussed were gas and electricity prices, on which Umar said no decision had been reached by the government to increase tariffs as reported in the media, in addition to withdrawing sales taxes and customs on imported raw materials, refunds of sales taxes, market-based exchange rates, duty drawback schemes and increasing the tax net. He said the government would provide gas and electricity to export-based sectors at regionally competitive rates, as promised prior the elections. He also met fertiliser manufacturers on the issue of pricing and subsidies with reference to their windfall profits made last year, and refusing to accept their demands, said manufacturers should shut down their units if they were not profitable at current prices; he said the new government\\'s priority was to provide fertilisers to farmers \"at affordable rates\" and this had been part of their original commitments. Umar also chaired a meeting of the National Executive Committee (NEC), which was formed to monitor the country\\'s anti-money laundering measures and countering of finances to terrorist organisations, as mandated by the Financial Action Task Force which had grey-listed Pakistan months earlier. Umar said implementation of the relevant measures would ensure Pakistan successfully meets international standards under the FATF action plan.\\n\\nOn 8 September, the PTI government scaled-down spending on the federal development program to Rs. 775 billion from Rs. 1,030 billion, under the 2018–19 Pakistan federal budget. The Planning Commission released Rs.35 billion for development projects, which was around 75% less than the same period last year, Rs. 135 billion. The cuts were due to several \"non-development projects\" of the previous PML-N government under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) facing the axe, as well as projects of governments before it, which had all been moved out of the PSDP. An official said the government would spend part of the savings on water sector projects, and also incorporate some of its own critical, priority projects under the spending regime. The progress of CPEC projects, including the Gwadar Smart Port City Master Plan and the structuring of industrial zones, were also reviewed.\\n\\nOn 27 September, eight buffaloes from the Prime Minister\\'s house were auctioned for nearly .\\n\\nEnvironmental initiatives\\nOn 24 August 2018, the cabinet decided to commence a major tree plantation project.

Under the campaign, the government aimed to plant at least 1.5 million saplings initially, and achieve \\'ten billion\\' tree plantations by the end of its term, as part of its \"tree tsunami\" and green environment policy to tackle climate change and air pollution.\\n\\nOn 13 October, Khan launched the \"Clean and Green Pakistan\" initiative at a school in Islamabad, where he also planted a sapling. Under the campaign, the government would aim to plant 10 billion trees by the end of its term, and also improve the country\\'s sewage and sanitation system. Whilst addressing school students, Khan emphasised the importance of trees in the context of global warming and pollution mitigation and stressed the important role that students played in creating awareness of the environmental movement. He said the cleanliness drive would also extend to impoverished areas such as slums, and that his aim was to bring Pakistan on par with Europe in terms of cleanliness during his term.\\n\\nWater conservation initiatives\\nThe Asian Development Bank approved a $100 million grant to address water scarcity projects in Balochistan on 4 September. On 7 September 2018, Khan made his second televised address to the nation. The speech, which was only a few minutes long, stressed the importance of the Diamer-Bhasha Dam and the extremely critical need for water storage infrastructure in Pakistan\\'s immediate future, which was faced with the threats of severe drought and depletion of resources. Khan called on overseas Pakistanis and also appealed to all country folk to generously donate to the public fund created by the Chief Justice of Pakistan which sought to raise money for the dam project; he stated: \"Our debt today stands at Rs30,000 billion but the biggest problem we currently face is the water crisis... When Pakistan was made, every Pakistani had 5600 cubic metres of water. Today that stands at only 1000 cubic metres... If every overseas Pakistani donates $1,000, we will have enough to build the dams ourselves... I know not every overseas Pakistani will be able to give $1,000, especially the ones working in the Middle East. To them, I would say that donate as much as you can... We alone will have to build this dam, and we can. We just have to make up our minds.\" He also cited an example of Egypt, where a similar public drive had been launched to build dams using national resources and said Pakistan\\'s current situation with rising foreign debt necessitated the need to reduce external financing. According to Khan, Pakistan\\'s current water storage capacity could last only 30 days in critical times whereas the internationally safe capacity was 120 days.\\n\\nThe speech was welcomed by Pakistanis abroad. Government departments and the private sector committed themselves to the cause; the Punjab government declared that all provincial cabinet members would be donating one month\\'s worth of salary to the dam fund, while the railways\\' ministry which announced it would donate Rs. 100 million to the dam fund every year. Real estate tycoon Malik Riaz and ARY Digital Network president Salman Iqbal donated 50 million and 10 million rupees to the fund respectively. The Express Tribune reported that before Khan\\'s speech, the dam fund established by Chief Justice of Pakistan had already collected around Rs 1.93 billion, and the vast majority (around Rs 1.91 billion) of funds had been raised domestically. According to the source, there was widespread enthusiasm among overseas compatriots to donate but they could not do so due to the select number of Pakistani bank branches abroad, as well as a lack of awareness on where, how and which avenues to donate through. The Chief Justice provided special instructions to the Governor of the State Bank of Pakistan to resolve these issues on an urgent basis.\\n\\nRelations with the military\\nOn 21 August 2018, Khan paid tribute to sufferers of terrorism and sang praise for the military and security agencies of Pakistan for combating terrorism.\\n\\nOn 27 August 2018, Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa extended his congratulations to Khan on being elected as premier; the two held their first meeting at Khan\\'s office, during which the country\\'s ongoing security situation and peace efforts were also discussed.\\n\\nOn 30 August 2018, Khan paid his first visit to General Headquarters (Pakistan Army) in Rawalpindi. The iconic claim of \"civil-military leadership on one page\" came on the new government\\'s day 13 when information minister cleared all doubts of differences between the civilian government and the military leadership by repeating that sentence but added that this time \"they share the same book\" as well. Khan\\'s meeting at the GHQ lasted eight hours, during which he received briefings on highly sensitive and confidential security matters from the military establishment. Next day, Khan invited prominent journalists and took them into confidence about his visit to GHQ.\\n\\nOn 3 September 2018, at his office, Khan held a one-on-one meeting with army chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the third such meeting since Khan assumed office. According to a press release, issues discussed included \"matters related to security\" which were broadly defined as \"Defence Day, US-Pakistan relations, and the internal and external security situation\".

Let\\'s play our role with diligence and devotion for the progress of the country\". Khan also said his foreign policy would prioritise the nation\\'s interests above all else, that Pakistan would \"not become part of a war of any other country\" in the future, and that he had been against the very War on Terror from the beginning. He also ruled out the frequently discussed \"civil-military\" dynamics as a myth, stating that \"There is no such thing as a civil-military tug of war... Our goals are same, that is to make Pakistan as one of the greatest countries of the world\".\\n\\nOn 7 September, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee, general Zubair Mahmood Hayat, held a meeting with Khan at the Prime Minister\\'s office and discussed matters relating to the armed forces.\\n\\nOn 6 October, Khan visited Quetta along with army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa, his first trip to Balochistan after taking charge.

He also said Pakistan\\'s overseas embassies would adopt a key role in this.\\n\\nOn 24 August 2018, a dispute arose after Mike Pompeo\\'s call with Khan with US State Department saying that Pompeo discussed \"terrorists operating from within Pakistan\" while Pakistan\\'s foreign office denying it in the strongest possible words but US State Department reaffirming its statement even after Pakistan\\'s denial.\\n\\nOn 27 August, the Chinese and Saudi Arabian ambassadors met Khan separately at his office, during which the envoys congratulated Khan and discussed the strength and progress of China–Pakistan relations and Pakistan–Saudi Arabia relations respectively.\\n\\nOn 28 August 2018, responding to a letter from the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, Khan\\'s human rights minister urged the organization to take up the matter of human rights violations against Palestinians by Israel and against Muslims living in the European countries in the form of restrictions on their dress code, building houses of worship, and the attacks on their religion.\\nA nine-member Indian delegation under the Permanent Indus Commission arrived in Pakistan on a two-day visit to discuss water sharing rights as per the Indus Waters Treaty, and to discuss bilateral concerns on current hydro-projects. Both sides agreed to allow each other to tour and inspect hydro-projects on their respective sides.\\n\\nOn 30 August 2018, United States State Department released the transcript of the call between Pompeo and Khan which proved that Pompeo discussed \"terrorists operating from Pakistan\", leading analysts to claim a diplomatic embarrassment for the Pakistani government. However, the Pakistani foreign ministry released a statement that it wanted to bury the matter and move forward ahead of Pompeo\\'s visit to Pakistan scheduled over the coming week: \"Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has already issued a detailed clarification and we will not comment further on this matter\". According to another official: \"Now, we don\\'t want to create more misunderstandings as we already have trust issues with the US. Raising this issue further could mean more misunderstandings\".

The news came ahead of a scheduled visit to Islamabad by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, general Joseph Dunford. Analysts speculated on how the developments may tie with Khan\\'s past stance against U.S. drone strikes, and his complete opposition to the U.S. presence inside Afghanistan. Pakistan\\'s foreign minister said that this money was not an aid instead it was a due right of Pakistan as a reimbursement for the losses suffered by the country in the war on terror.

Prior to leaving for Pakistan, Pompeo had said: \"First stop Pakistan; a new leader there. I wanted to get out there at the beginning of his [Khan\\'s] time in an effort to reset the relationship between the two countries... There are lots of challenges between our two nations for sure, but we’re hopeful that with the new leadership, we can find common ground and begin to work on some of our shared problems together... So we’ll have three opportunities to walk through the complexity that is this relationship and hopefully begin to make some progress so that we can get back to a set of common understandings... We need Pakistan to seriously engage to help us get to the reconciliation we need in Afghanistan\". The U.S. embassy issued a press release stating Pompeo \"emphasised the important role Pakistan could play in bringing about a negotiated peace in Afghanistan, and conveyed the need for Pakistan to take \"sustained and decisive measures against terrorists and militants threatening regional peace and stability\". Pakistan\\'s foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi held a press conference following the meetings however and said, while responding to questions, that there was no demand of \"do more\" from Washington. Qureshi said there had been a \\'forward movement\\', and that the negotiations, which he described as being held in a very \"cordial and positive\" environment, set the stage for \"resetting the ties and the impasse in the relationship has been broken.\" He dismissed perceptions that there had been any tough talks from either side during the meeting, stating the environment of the meeting had in fact resulted in ice being thawed. He also said that the prime minister and army leadership had participated in the main meeting jointly, to send a message that all institutions were on the same page. Regarding Afghanistan\\'s peace process, he commented that \"This is the position Imran has been advocating for years. It is a welcome development that the US has expressed readiness for direct talks with the Taliban.\" Information minister Fawad Chaudhry that nearly 3,000 Pakistani prisoners facing death row in Iran were going to be granted relief in the wake of Tehran amending its anti-narcotics laws, and that the Pakistani government had raised this matter with Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif during his visit.\\n\\nA Saudi trade delegation led by the Saudi deputy minister for foreign trade, Abdul Rahman Al-Harbi, met with Pakistani trade and commerce ministry officials led by commerce secretary Mohammed Younus Dagha in Islamabad. Both sides pledged to boost their $3.2 billion trade further, as well as increasing investment and private sector trade, and expanding ties in the oil, gas and petrochemical sectors. Indonesia announced that it was sending a trade mission to Pakistan to study its industry, and also to tap the local market for its palm oil exports.\\n\\nOn 7 September, China\\'s foreign minister Wang Yi became the latest foreign dignitary after Iran, Japan, and the United States, to arrive in Pakistan, on a three-day visit to discuss bilateral relations and the ongoing economic projects under the multibillion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. Wang met with Qureshi, as did their respective delegations, and also met Khan and army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa. Following their meeting, the two foreign ministers held a press conference during which both announced the two countries had agreed to deepen their ongoing strategic cooperation. Qureshi said CPEC was a vital instrument of Pakistan\\'s socio-economic development and said both sides touched upon their bilateral trade, poverty alleviation efforts, cultural links, job creations and education sector developments. Previously, Khan had made many references to emulating the Chinese model of rapid social and economic development in Pakistan. The Chinese side lauded Pakistan\\'s counter-terrorism efforts, and Yi emphasised that \"China will continue to support Pakistan as per its foreign policy\". He extended an invitation to Khan to attend the 2018 Chinese International Import Expo as a guest of honour. The two sides appreciated Pakistan\\'s provision of security to Chinese citizens in Pakistan which included workers. Yi also offered clarification on China\\'s One Belt, One Road projects in Pakistan under the aegis of the CPEC, and said the projects were not \"debt\" but rather investments that would \"unleash huge economic benefits.. and these will create considerable returns to the Pakistani economy.\" He explained the CPEC projects had so far created 70,000 jobs in Pakistan and added to economic growth by one to two per cent. An article in The Financial Times dated 9 September claimed that Pakistan was planning to renegotiate the terms of agreements existing under CPEC, especially those that were perceived to be tilted away from Pakistan\\'s favour; the report quoted Abdul Razzaq Dawood, the cabinet member for commerce, textiles and industry stating: \"The previous government did a bad job negotiating with China on CPEC — they didn\\'t do their homework correctly and didn\\'t negotiate correctly so they gave away a lot. Chinese companies received tax breaks, many breaks and have an undue advantage in Pakistan; this is one of the things we\\'re looking at because it\\'s not fair that Pakistan companies should be disadvantaged\". However, this report was swiftly refuted later by both Pakistani and Chinese government sources; Dawood said he had been quoted \"out of context\" in many parts of the report, on which he would be adding clarification, while the commerce ministry said CPEC was a national priority under Pakistan\\'s long-term economic plans whose future held \"complete unanimity\". The Chinese embassy in Islamabad clarified that CPEC was a mutually beneficial project, which was being carried forward by both governments \"according to the needs of Pakistan and for the development of Pakistan\".\\n\\nOn 7 September, Saudi Arabia\\'s minister for information and culture Awwad Alawwad also arrived in the country and met his Pakistani counterpart, Fawad Chaudhry.

Foreign minister wrote a letter to OIC secretary-general to call up a meeting to discuss the matter of offensive caricatures. On 29 August 2018, the Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan head Khadim Hussain Rizvi demanded the government to cut all ties with Dutch government, kick out its ambassador from Islamabad, summon Pakistani ambassador back from Netherlands, and toughen the stance against United States since irreligious caricature contest judge is an American. Following Pakistan\\'s diplomatic escalation to the Dutch government against a blasphemous caricature contest planned by Dutch MP Geert Wilders, he announced on 30 August 2018 that the contest had been cancelled for safety reasons. The Pakistani government credited their stance on the issue and said a \"major crisis\" had been averted. On Twitter, whilst reacting to a Pakistani foreign ministry statement, Wilders wrote: \"Don\\'t claim victory too soon. I am not finished with you yet. I will expose your barbarism in many other ways.\"\\n\\nGovernment reforms and other initiatives\\nOn 17 August, a day before Khan took oath as premier, the Supreme Court ruled a landmark decision allowing overseas Pakistanis the right to vote via an internet system.

Alam Road, leaving several people stranded inside the building. One man died of injuries after he jumped from the building to save himself. Fire brigades arrived on the site to douse off the flames. According to minister Fayaz-ul-Hasan Chohan, \"every single person was rescued from the building\". The plaza reportedly belonged to the son-in-law of Shehbaz Sharif.

Muhammad Afzal Qadri, a TLP co-founder, also called for the death of the three Supreme Court justices involved in hearing Bibi\\'s appeal, stating \"The Chief Justice and two others deserve to be killed ... Either their security guards, their drivers, or their chefs should kill them.\"\\n\\nOn 2 November 2018, the Government of Pakistan under the administration of Imran Khan and the Tehreek-e-Labbaik political party, which encouraged the protests against Asia Bibi, came into an agreement that barred Asia Bibi from leaving the country, in addition to releasing Tehreek-e-Labbaik protesters who were under arrest. The deal includes expediting a motion in the court to place Asia Noreen on Pakistan\\'s no fly list, known officially as the Exit Control List (ECL). Due to pressure from Tehreek-e-Labbaik, Pakistani authorities will not release Asia Noreen until the \"Supreme Court makes a final review of its verdict\" as \"Ghulam Mustafa, the lawyer representing a provincial cleric in Punjab who had filed the initial blasphemy charges against Bibi, petitioned the Supreme Court requesting that the judges review her acquittal.\"\\n\\nThis agreement between the Government of Pakistan and Tehreek-e-Labbaik has led to \"allegations [that] the government was capitulating to extremists\". Pakistani Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry responded to these allegations, saying that \"We had two options: either to use force and when you use force people can be killed. That is not something a state should do... We tried negotiations and (in) negotiations you take something and you leave something.\" Asia Noreen\\'s lawyer Saif-ul-Mulook called the agreement between the Government of Pakistan and the Islamists \"painful\", stating that \"They cannot even implement an order of the country\\'s highest court\". Feeling that his life was threatened, Mulook fled to Europe in order \"to stay alive as I still have to fight the legal battle for Asia Bibi.\" British Pakistani Christian Association chairman Wilson Chowdhry stated that “I am not surprised that Imran Khan\\'s regime has caved in to extremists”. Jemima Goldsmith, an ex-wife of Imran Khan, similarly \"said that Pakistan\\'s government caved in to extremist demands to bar Asia Bibi from leaving the country\", opining \"Not the Naya Pakistan we\\'d hoped for. 3 days after a defiant & brave speech defending the judiciary, Pakistan\\'s gov caves in to extremist demands to bar #AsiaBibi from leaving Pak, after she was acquitted of blasphemy- effectively signing her death warrant.\"\\n\\nOn 7 November 2018, Asia Bibi was released from New Jail for Women in Multan, flown to PAF Base Nur Khan, from whence she then departed the country on a charter plane, to the Netherlands. Hafiz Shahbaz Attari of the Islamist political party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), upon hearing the news, said that TLP members would gather in Islamabad and Rawalpindi to try and prevent the departure of Asia Bibi to the Netherlands.\\n\\nLegal challenges\\nOn 6 September, the Lahore High Court received a Petition challenging Khan\\'s election as Prime Minister. The petition argued that 69 members of the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament, abstained from casting their vote in the session held to elect the new Prime Minister, and that therefore Khan had been elected unconstitutionally. The court admitted the petition, issued notices to the respondents and set a date of 1 November to hear the petitioner\\'s case.\\n\\nIncidents\\nOn 22 August 2018, the railway minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad allegedly \"manhandled an elderly woman\" who was weeping after his guards did not allow her to meet him. He then went on to break the phone of a TV cameraman who was trying to record the incident. On 26 August 2018, during his first meeting with Railway officials, Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed got upset over the briefing by officials in which the performance of railways under his predecessor Khawaja Saad Rafique was highlighted, Ahmed admonished the officials for praising the former minister which resulted in one of the officials requesting a long leave who stated that he will not be able to work under an \"ill-mannered\" and \"unqualified\" minister.\\n\\nOn 27 August 2018, a police officer from Pakpattan was removed from his duties as District Police Officer and transferred to Lahore as an OSD over a row with Khawar Maneka, former husband of Prime Minister Imran Khan\\'s wife Bushra Bibi. Allegedly the officer was asked by Chief Minister of Punjab, Usman Buzdar to tender an apology to Bibi\\'s former husband whose vehicle was chased by the said officer since he did not stop at the police check post. The officer declined the apology demand saying his department was not at fault. It is also reported that allegedly the first lady played a role in this demotion through the prime minister. However, IG Punjab, denied this story and maintained that he was transferred without any political interference, due to his misconduct during this incident and false reporting of this incident to his superiors.\\n\\nOn 28 August 2018, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf\\'s leader from Karachi, Aamir Liaquat Hussain seemed to distance himself from the party saying that he was being treated like an outsider. Taking account of that behaviour he might decide to sit on opposition benches.\\n\\nOn 30 August 2018, Fayyaz ul Hassan Chohan, Punjab government\\'s minister for information and culture caused controversy by using obscene language against television staff and passing \"vulgar and derogatory misogynistic remarks\" against actresses of Lollywood. After it drew a huge storm of criticism Chohan tendered an apology to the actresses, he maintained, that he respects all actresses, the said remark was slip of tongue while answering the question on vulgar content in theatres.\\n\\nOn 1 September 2018, Chief Justice Saqib Nisar ordered one of PTI\\'s lawmakers from Sindh, Imran Ali Shah, to donate Rs. 3 million to a public fund for the construction of Diamer-Bhasha Dam as a fine; Shah had been involved in a controversy days after the elections, when a video of him slapping and physically assaulting a man on the street during a heated argument surfaced online, sparking outrage on social media. Shah later apologised for his actions to the victim personally; his membership of PTI\\'s Sindh chapter was suspended for a month, and he was also ordered by the party to pay Rs. 500,000 in fines as well as bear the costs of medical treatment for 20 patients at an Edhi Foundation centre. The case was marked closed.\\n\\nThe role of opposition\\nOn 8 September, Shehbaz Sharif, leader of the opposing PML-N held his first press conference since the general elections concluded. During the conference, Sharif accused Khan of coming into power through mass rigging and questioned why a parliamentary commission into rigging allegations had not been constituted yet. He also accused the PTI of increasing gas, electricity and fertilizer prices, criticized their progress in power generation projects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, lamented the government\\'s abolishment of Prime Minister\\'s Laptop Scheme initiated by Nawaz Sharif, and said Khan should attract investors for constructing the Diamer-Bhasha dam rather than relying only on collecting public funding. He also hit out at Khan\\'s pronounced austerity measures, stating the PML-N had adopted such type of measures throughout its own tenure.\\n\\nAhead of the 2018 by-elections, it was announced that the two main opposition parties, PML-N and PPP, would be arranging seat adjustments with one another and contesting the by-polls together as a united front against the PTI. Imran Khan has again vowed not to let the corrupt go, which appears to be on the goal of the main opposition parties (NRO).\\n\\nSee also\\nPrime Ministership of Imran Khan\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\nImran Khan\\nImran Khan administration', 'Sports are an important part of culture in the United States of America. American football is the most popular spectator sport to watch in the United States, followed by baseball, basketball, ice hockey, and soccer, which make up the \"five major sports\". Indoor American football, rugby union, Cricket, tennis, golf, auto racing, softball, lacrosse, field hockey, water polo, and mixed martial arts, among others, are also somewhat popular sports played in the country.\\n\\nBased on revenue, the  major professional sports leagues in the United States are Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), Major League Soccer (MLS), and the National Hockey League (NHL). The market for professional sports in the United States is roughly $69 billion, roughly 50% larger than that of all of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined. All these leagues enjoy wide-ranging domestic media coverage and, except for Major League Soccer, all are considered the preeminent leagues in their respective sports in the world, although American football does not have a substantial following in other nations. With an average attendance of over 20,000 per game, MLS has the third-highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S. after the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB), and is the seventh-highest attended professional soccer league worldwide. Of these five U.S.-based leagues, all but the NFL have at least one team in Canada.\\n\\nProfessional teams in all major sports in the United States operate as franchises within a league, meaning that a team may move to a different city if the team\\'s owners believe there would be a financial benefit, but franchise moves are usually subject to some form of league-level approval.  All major sports leagues use a similar type of regular-season schedule with a post-season playoff tournament.  In addition to the major league–level organizations, several sports also have professional minor leagues, active in smaller cities across the country. As in Canada and Australia, sports leagues in the United States do not practice promotion and relegation, unlike most sports leagues in Europe.\\n\\nSports are particularly associated with education in the United States, with most high schools and universities having organized sports, and this is a unique sporting footprint for the U.S. College sports competitions play an important role in the American sporting culture, and college basketball and college football are as popular as professional sports in some parts of the country. The major sanctioning body for college sports is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\\n\\nBased on Olympic Games, World Championships, and other major competitions in respective sports, the United States is the most successful nation in baseball, basketball, athletics, swimming, lacrosse, beach volleyball, figure skating, tennis, golf, boxing, diving, shooting, rowing and snowboarding, and is all time one of the top five most successful nations in ice hockey, wrestling, gymnastics, volleyball, speed skating, alpine skiing, bobsleigh, equestrian, sailing, cycling, weightlifting and archery, among others. This makes the United States the most successful sports nation in the world. The United States has placed first in the Summer Olympic medal table 18 times out of 29 Summer Olympics and 28 appearances. Unlike most other nations, the United States government does not provide funding for sports nor for the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nAmerican football, indoor American football, baseball, softball, and indoor soccer evolved out of older British (Rugby football, British baseball, Rounders, and association football) sports. However, basketball, volleyball, beach volleyball, racquetball, skateboarding, snowboarding, Ultimate, wind-surfing, and Water Skiing are fully American inventions, some of which have become popular in other countries and worldwide.</ref>\\n\\nIn colonial Virginia and Maryland, sports occupied a great deal of attention at every social level. In England, hunting was severely restricted to landowners. In America, game was more than plentiful. Everyone—including servants and slaves—could and did hunt, so there was no social distinction to be had. In 1691, Sir Francis Nicholson, the governor of Virginia, organized competitions for the “better sort of Virginians onely who are  especially in the South. It involved owners, trainers and spectators from all social classes and both races. However, religious evangelists were troubled by the gambling dimension, and democratic elements complained that it was too aristocratic, since only the rich could own very expensive competitive horses.\\n\\nOlympics\\n\\nThe United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) is the National Olympic Committee for the United States. U.S. athletes have won a total of 2,522 medals  (1,022 of them being gold) at the Summer Olympic Games and another 305 at the Winter Olympic Games. Most medals have been won in the sport of athletics (track and field) (801, 32%) and swimming (553, 22%). American swimmer Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympic athlete of all time, with 28 Olympic medals, 23 of them gold.\\n\\nThe United States has sent athletes to every celebration of the modern Olympic Games except the 1980 Summer Olympics hosted by the Soviet Union in Moscow, which it boycotted because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\\n\\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,673 medals (1,075 of them gold) at the Summer Olympic Games and another 305 (105 of them gold) at the Winter Olympic Games, making the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics. The US is ranked first in the all-time medal table even if all the incarnations of Russia and Germany are combined, leading the second-placed Russians by 402 gold and 917 total medals. These achievements are even more impressive considering the fact that the American Olympic team remains the only in the world to receive no government funding.\\n\\nThe United States hosted both Summer and Winter Games in 1932, and has hosted more Games than any other country – eight times, four times each for the Summer and Winter Games:\\n The 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, 1932 Summer Olympics and 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles; and the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta;\\n The 1932 Winter Olympics and 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York; the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, California; and the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.\\n\\nLos Angeles will host the Summer Olympics for a third time in 2028, marking the ninth time the U.S. hosts the Olympic Games.\\n\\nThe United States has won the most gold and overall medals in the Summer Olympic Games, even if the medal totals of the Soviet Union/CIS and Russia are combined, and has topped the medal table 18 times. The country has won the second most gold and overall medals in the Winter Olympic Games, behind Norway, but has topped the medal table only one time, in 1932. If all of Germany\\'s and Russia\\'s incarnations are combined, the United States slips to fourth in the all-time Winter Olympic Games table.\\n\\nAmateurism and professionalism\\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The 1912 Olympic pentathlon and decathlon champion Jim Thorpe was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the IOC in 1983 on compassionate grounds.\\n\\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the Eastern Bloc countries eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis. The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from amateurism, as envisioned by Pierre de Coubertin, to allowing participation of professional athletes, but only in the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union and its influence within the International Olympic Committee.\\n\\nIndividual sports\\n\\nMotorsports\\n\\nMotorsports are widely popular in the United States but Americans generally show little interest in the major international competitions, such as the Formula One Grand Prix series and MotoGP, preferring home-grown racing series.  However, some Americans have achieved great success in these international series, such as Mario Andretti and Kenny Roberts.\\n\\nAmericans, like the rest of the world, initially began using public streets to host automobile races, but these venues were often unsafe to the public as they offered relatively little crowd control. Promoters and drivers in the United States discovered that horse racing tracks could provide better conditions for drivers and spectators than public streets. This, in turn, was succeeded by board track racing (which was short-lived as many of the tracks were highly flammable and difficult to maintain) followed by oval track racing, which remains the dominant form of racing in the United States but is not used in the rest of the world; road racing has generally waned. However, an extensive, albeit illegal street racing culture still persists.\\n\\nIndyCar Series\\n\\nHistorically, open wheel racing was the most popular form of U.S. motorsport nationwide. However, an acrimonious split (often referred to by many as \"The Split\") in 1994 between the primary series, CART (later known as Champ Car), and the owner of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (the site of the Indy 500), Tony George, led to the formation of the Indy Racing League, now known as INDYCAR, which launched the rival IndyCar Series in 1996. From that point on, the popularity of open wheel racing in the U.S. declined dramatically. The feud was settled in 2008 with an agreement to merge the two series under the IndyCar banner, but enormous damage had already been done to the sport. Post-merger, IndyCar continues to run with slight viewership gains per year. However, as a result, the only post-Split IndyCar race that still enjoys widespread popularity among the general public is the Indianapolis 500.\\n\\nNASCAR\\n\\nThe CART-IRL Split coincided with an enormous expansion of stock car racing, governed by NASCAR, from its past as a mostly regional circuit mainly followed in the Southern United States to a truly national sport.  NASCAR\\'s audience peaked in the early 2000s, and has declined quite a bit ever since the implementation of the Chase for the Cup in 2004, though it continues to have around 2–4 million viewers per race. Among NASCAR\\'s popular former drivers are Jeff Gordon, Dale Earnhardt, Jimmie Johnson, Tony Stewart, Dale Earnhardt Jr., and Richard Petty. Among NASCAR\\'s popular active drivers are Kevin Harvick, Alex Bowman, Kurt Busch, Kyle Busch, Chase Elliott, Ryan Blaney, and Kyle Larson. NASCAR\\'s most popular race is the Daytona 500, the opening race of the season, held each year at Daytona Beach, Florida in February.\\n\\nOther motorsports\\nNotable sports car races in the United States are the 24 Hours of Daytona, 12 Hours of Sebring, and Petit Le Mans, which have featured in the World Sportscar Championship, IMSA GT Championship, Intercontinental Le Mans Cup, FIA World Endurance Championship, American Le Mans Series, Rolex Sports Car Series and currently the United SportsCar Championship.\\n\\nAnother one of the most popular forms of motorsports in the United States is the indigenous sport of drag racing. The largest drag racing organization is the National Hot Rod Association.\\n\\nSeveral other motorsports enjoy varying degrees of popularity in the United States: short track motor racing, motocross, monster truck competitions (including the popular Monster Jam circuit), demolition derby, figure 8 racing, mud bogging and tractor pulling.\\n\\nGolf\\n\\nGolf is played in the United States by about 24\\xa0million people. The sport\\'s national governing body, the United States Golf Association (USGA), is jointly responsible with The R&A for setting and administering the rules of golf. The USGA conducts four national championships open to professionals: the U.S. Open, U.S. Women\\'s Open, U.S. Senior Open, and the U.S. Senior Women\\'s Open, with the last of these holding its first edition in 2018. The PGA of America organizes the PGA Championship, Senior PGA Championship and Women\\'s PGA Championship. Three legs of the Grand Slam of Golf are based in the United States: the PGA Championship, U.S. Open and The Masters. (The Open Championship, known in the U.S. as the British Open, is played in the United Kingdom.)\\n\\nThe PGA Tour is the main professional golf tour in the United States, and the LPGA Tour is the main women\\'s professional tour. Also of note is PGA Tour Champions, where players 50 and older compete. Golf is aired on several television networks, such as Golf Channel, NBC, ESPN, CBS and Fox.\\n\\nNotable American male golfers include Walter Hagen (11 majors), Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus (record 18 major wins), Arnold Palmer, and Tiger Woods (15 major wins). Notable female golfers include Patty Berg (record 15 major wins), Mickey Wright (13 majors), Louise Suggs and Babe Zaharias.\\n\\nTennis\\n\\nTennis is played in the United States in all five categories (Men\\'s and Ladies\\' Singles; Men\\'s, Ladies\\' and Mixed Doubles); however, the most popular are the singles. The pinnacle of the sport in the country is the US Open played in late August at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York. The Indian Wells Masters, Miami Open and Cincinnati Masters are part of the ATP Tour Masters 1000 and the former WTA Tier I (currently Premier Mandatory and Premier 5).\\n\\nThe United States has had considerable success in tennis for many years, with players such as Don Budge, Billie Jean King (12 major singles titles), Chris Evert (18 major singles titles), Jimmy Connors (8 major singles titles), John McEnroe (7 major singles titles), Andre Agassi (8 major singles titles) and Pete Sampras (14 major singles titles), and Ricardo Alonso González (14 major singles titles) dominating their sport in the past. More recently, the Williams sisters, Venus Williams (7 major singles titles) and Serena Williams (23 major singles titles), have been a dominant force in the women\\'s game, and the twin brothers Bob and Mike Bryan have claimed almost all significant career records for men\\'s doubles teams.\\n\\nTrack and field\\n\\nUSA Track & Field is the governing body for track and field in the United States. It organizes the annual USA Outdoor Track and Field Championships and USA Indoor Track and Field Championships. The Diamond League currently features one round in the United States, the Prefontaine Classic; the series formerly included the Adidas Grand Prix as well. Three of the World Marathon Majors are held in the United States: the Boston Marathon, Chicago Marathon and New York City Marathon. The Freihofer\\'s Run for Women is also an IAAF Road Race Label Event. Amateur organizations such as the National Collegiate Athletic Association and Amateur Athletic Union sanction cross-country running in fall, indoor track and field in winter, and outdoor track and field in spring.\\n\\nJesse Owens was a notable US track athlete who achieved international fame at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Germany, by winning four gold medals: 100 meters, long jump, 200 meters, and 4 × 100-meter relay. He was the most successful athlete at the Games and, as a black man, was credited with \"single-handedly crushing Hitler\\'s myth of Aryan supremacy\", although he \"wasn\\'t invited to the White House to shake hands with the President, either\".\\n\\nAmericans have frequently set world standards in various disciplines of track and field for both male and female athletes. Tyson Gay and Michael Johnson hold various sprint records for male athletes, while Florence Griffith Joyner set various world sprint records for female athletes. Mary Slaney set many world records for middle-distance disciplines.\\n\\nA turning point occurred in US track in the running boom of the 1970s. After a series of American successes in various distances from marathoners Frank Shorter and Bill Rodgers as well as middle-distance runners Dave Wottle and Steve Prefontaine, running as an American pastime began to take shape. The U.S. win in the 1976 Olympic men\\'s decathlon, achieved by then-Bruce Jenner, made Jenner a national celebrity. High school track in the United States became a unique foundation for creating the United States middle-distance running talent pool, and from 1972 to 1981 an average of 13 high school boys in the United States would run under 4:10 in the mile per year. During this time, several national high school records in the United States were set and remained largely unbroken until the 2000s. The number of high school boys running the mile under 4:10 per year dropped abruptly from 1982, and female participation in many distance events was forbidden by athletic authorities until the 1980s. However a renaissance in high school track developed when Jack Daniels, a former Olympian, published a training manual called \"Daniels\\' Running Formula\", which became the most widely used distance training protocol among American coaches along with Arthur Lydiard\\'s high-mileage regimen. Carl Lewis is credited with \"normalizing\" the practice of having a lengthy track career as opposed to retiring once reaching the age when it is less realistic of gaining a personal best result. The United States is home to school-sponsored track and field, a tradition in which most schools from middle school through college feature a track and field team. Owing to the number of American athletes who satisfy Olympic norm standards, the US holds national trials to select the best of its top-tier athletes for Olympic competition.\\n\\nCombat sports\\n\\nBoxing\\n\\nBoxing is an iconic sport in the US and is the focus of the most successful sporting movies both critically and commercially with Oscar winning films like Rocky, Raging Bull and The Fighter. As with many sports it has allowed Black Athletes to breakthrough to be become major figures of US culture, with Joe Louis, Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali all becoming know on the world stage.\\n\\nBoxing in the United States became the center of professional boxing in the early 20th century. The National Boxing Association was founded in 1921 and began to sanction title fights.\\n\\nJoe Louis was an American professional boxer who competed from 1934 to 1951. He reigned as the world heavyweight champion from 1937 to 1949, and is considered to be one of the greatest heavyweight boxers of all time. In 2005, Louis was ranked as the best heavyweight of all time by the International Boxing Research Organization, and was ranked number one on The Ring magazine\\'s list of the \"100 greatest punchers of all time\". Louis had the longest single reign as champion of any heavyweight boxer in history.\\n\\nLouis is widely regarded as the first person of African-American descent to achieve the status of a nationwide hero within the United States, and was also a focal point of anti-Nazi sentiment leading up to and during World War II. He was instrumental in integrating the game of golf, breaking the sport\\'s color barrier in America by appearing under a sponsor\\'s exemption in a PGA event in 1952.\\n\\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, Muhammad Ali became an iconic figure, transformed the role and image of the African American athlete in America by his embrace of racial pride, and transcended the sport by refusing to serve in the Vietnam War.\\n\\nIn the 1980s Mike Tyson emerged as a serious contender. Nicknamed \"Iron Mike\", Tyson won the heavyweight unification series to become world heavyweight champion at the age of 20 and the first undisputed champion in a decade. Tyson soon became the most widely known boxer since Ali due to an aura of unrestrained ferocity, such as that exuded by Jack Dempsey or Sonny Liston. His career culminated in Evander Holyfield vs. Mike Tyson II where he famously bit off a piece of Holyfield\\'s ear.\\n\\nSince the late 1990s boxing has declined in popularity for a myriad of factors such as more sports entertainment options and combat alternatives such as MMA\\'s UFC amongst a younger demographic. Lack of mainstream coverage in newspapers and access on major television networks. Also the lack of a US Heavyweight world champion.\\n\\nIt was hoped in 2015 that the Floyd Mayweather Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao fight would re-invigorate interest in the sport in the United States but because the fight was disappointing it was perceived as doing further harm to the image of the sport in the United States.\\n\\nOther Combat Sports\\n\\nMixed martial arts in the United States developed in the 1990s, and has achieved popularity in the early 21st century. Many companies promote MMA cards, with the U.S. based UFC the most dominant.\\n\\nTraditional wrestling is performed at the scholastic level; high school wrestling a popular participatory sports for young men in the United States, and college wrestling has a small following.\\n\\nJudo in the United States is not very popular and is eclipsed by more popular martial arts like karate and taekwondo.\\n\\nSwimming and water sports\\n\\nSwimming is a major competitive sport at high school and college level, but receives little mainstream media attention outside of the Olympics.\\n\\nSurfing in the United States and watersports are popular in the U.S. in coastal areas. California and Hawaii are the most popular locations for surfing. The Association of Surfing Professionals was founded in 1983.\\n\\nFive separate national governing bodies (NGBs) make up USAS: USA Swimming, USA Diving, United States Synchronized Swimming, USA Water Polo, and U.S. Masters Swimming. Of the five, only U.S. Masters Swimming (USMS) is not a member of the United States Olympic Committee (USMS\\'s main aim is adult swimming, exclusive of Olympic-swimming which is the domain of USA Swimming).\\n\\nPopular team sports\\n\\nOverview\\nThe most popular team sports in the United States are American football, baseball, basketball, ice hockey, and soccer. All five of these team sports are popular with fans, are widely watched on television, have a fully professional league, are played by millions of Americans, enjoy varsity status at many Division I colleges, and are played in high schools throughout the country.\\n\\n TV viewing record measures the game with the most TV viewers in the U.S. since 2005 for each sport: 2015 Super Bowl, 2016 NBA Finals Game 7, 2016 World Series Game 7, 2014 FIFA World Cup Final, and 2010 Winter Olympics Gold medal ice hockey game.\\n The column titled \"States (HS)\" represents the number of states that sponsor the sport at the high school level. For the purpose of this table, Washington, D.C. is counted as a state.\\n\\nAmerican football\\n\\nFootball has the most participants of any sport at both high school and college levels, the vast majority of its participants being male.\\n\\nThe NFL is the preeminent professional football league in the United States. The NFL has 32 franchises divided into two conferences. After a 17-game regular season, each conference sends seven teams to the NFL Playoffs, which eventually culminate in the league\\'s championship game, the Super Bowl.\\n\\nNationwide, the NFL obtains the highest television ratings among major sports. Watching NFL games on television on Sunday afternoons has become a common routine for many Americans during the football season. \\nSuper Bowl Sunday is the biggest annual sporting event held in the United States. The Super Bowl itself is always among the highest-rated programs of all-time in the Nielsen ratings.\\n\\nThe NFL has the highest average attendance (67,591) of any professional sports league in the world and has the highest revenue out of any single professional sports league.\\n\\nMillions watch college football throughout the fall months, and some communities, particularly in rural areas, place great emphasis on their local high school football teams. The popularity of college and high school football in areas such as the Southern United States (Southeastern Conference) and the Great Plains (Big 12 Conference and Big Ten Conference) stems largely from the fact that these areas historically generally did not possess markets large enough for a professional team. Nonetheless, college football has a rich history in the United States, predating the NFL by decades, and fans and alumni are generally very passionate about their teams.\\n\\nDuring football season in the fall, fans have the opportunity to watch high school games on Fridays and Saturdays, college football on Saturdays, and NFL games on Sundays, the usual playing day of the professional teams. However, some colleges play games on Tuesday and Wednesday nights, while the NFL offers weekly games on Monday (since 1970) and Thursday (since 2006). As recently as 2013, one could find a nationally televised professional or college game on television any night between Labor Day and Thanksgiving weekend.\\n\\nIndoor football or arena football, a form of football played in indoor arenas, has several professional and semi-professional leagues. The Arena Football League was active from 1987 to 2008 and folded in 2009, but several teams from the AFL and its former minor league, af2, relaunched the league in 2010. The AFL folded again in 2019. Most extant indoor leagues date to the mid-2000s and are regional in nature.\\n\\nDedicated women\\'s football is seldom seen. A few amateur and semi-professional leagues exist, of varying degrees of stability and competition. Football is unique among scholastic sports in the U.S. in that no women\\'s division exists for the sport; women who wish to play football in high school or college must compete directly with men.\\n\\nIndoor American football has several professional leagues such as, Indoor Football League, Champions Indoor Football, American West Football Conference, National Arena League, and American Arena League.\\n\\nBaseball\\n\\nBaseball and a variant, softball, are popular participatory sports in the U.S. Baseball was the first professional sport in the United States. The highest level of baseball in the U.S. and the world is Major League Baseball. The World Series of Major League Baseball is the culmination of the sport\\'s postseason each October. It is played between the winner of each of the two leagues, the American League and the National League, and the winner is determined through a best-of-seven playoff.\\n\\nThe New York Yankees are noted for having won more titles than any other US major professional sports franchise. The Yankees\\' chief rivals, the Boston Red Sox, also enjoy a huge following in Boston and throughout New England. The Philadelphia Phillies of the National League are the oldest continuous, one-name, one-city franchise in all of professional American sports, and enjoy a fanbase renowned for their rabid support of their team throughout Philadelphia and the Delaware Valley, and have famously been dubbed as the \"Meanest Fans in America\". Midwest baseball has also grown exponentially with teams like the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, and Cincinnati Reds. Particularly with Chicago sports fans who avidly follow the Chicago Cubs and the Chicago White Sox despite the comparative lack of success for the teams, with Chicago Cub fans being known throughout the country as one of the best baseball fans in the country, most notably for their passionate loyalty to the team despite their not having won a championship from 1908 to 2016 (108 years) which stands as the longest championship drought in US sports history. The sport has also taken hold of fans on the West Coast, most notably the rivalry between the San Francisco Giants and The Los Angeles Dodgers. Historically, the leagues were much more competitive, and cities such as Boston, Philadelphia and St. Louis had rival teams in both leagues up until the 1950s.\\n\\nNotable American baseball players in history include Babe Ruth (714 career home runs), Ty Cobb (career leader in batting average and batting titles), Cy Young, Honus Wagner, Ted Williams (.344 career batting average), Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle (16-time all star), Stan Musial, Willie Mays, Yogi Berra (18-time All-Star), Hank Aaron (career home run leader from 1974 to 2007), Mike Schmidt (548 career home runs, 10 career Gold Gloves), Nolan Ryan (career strikeouts leader), Roger Clemens (7 Cy Young awards), Derek Jeter and Jackie Robinson, who was instrumental in dissolving the color line and allowing African-Americans into the major leagues.\\n\\nAn extensive minor league baseball system covers most mid-sized cities in the United States. Minor league baseball teams are organized in a six-tier hierarchy, in which the highest teams (AAA) are in major cities that do not have a major league team but often have a major team in another sport, and each level occupies progressively smaller cities. The lowest levels of professional baseball serve primarily as development systems for the sport\\'s most inexperienced prospects, with the absolute bottom, the rookie leagues, occupying the major league squads\\' spring training complexes.\\n\\nSome limited independent professional baseball exists, the most prominent being the Atlantic League, which occupies mostly suburban locales that are not eligible for high level minor league teams of their own because they are too close to other major or minor league teams.\\n\\nOutside the minor leagues are collegiate summer baseball leagues, which occupy towns even smaller than those at the lower end of minor league baseball and typically cannot support professional sports. Summer baseball is an amateur exercise and uses players that choose not to play for payment in order to remain eligible to play college baseball for their respective universities in the spring. At the absolute lowest end of the organized baseball system is senior amateur baseball (also known as Town Team Baseball), which typically plays its games only on weekends and uses rosters composed of local residents.\\n\\nLiga de Béisbol Profesional Roberto Clemente is a professional baseball league in Puerto Rico.\\n\\nBasketball\\n\\nOf those Americans citing their favorite sport, basketball is ranked second (counting amateur levels) behind football. However, in regards to revenue the NBA is ranked third in popularity. More Americans play basketball than any other team sport, according to the National Sporting Goods Association, with over 26 million Americans playing basketball.\\nBasketball was invented in 1891 by Canadian physical education teacher James Naismith in Springfield, Massachusetts.\\n\\nThe National Basketball Association (NBA) is the world\\'s premier professional basketball league and one of the major professional sports leagues of North America. It contains 30 teams (29 teams in the U.S. and 1 in Canada) that play an 82-game season from October to June. After the regular season, eight teams from each conference compete in the playoffs for the Larry O\\'Brien Championship Trophy.\\n\\nSince the 1992 Summer Olympics, NBA players have represented the United States in international competition and won numerous important tournaments. The Dream Team was the unofficial nickname of the United States men\\'s basketball team that won the gold medal at the 1992 Olympics.\\n\\nBasketball at both the college and high school levels is popular throughout the country. Every March, a 68-team, six-round, single-elimination tournament (commonly called March Madness) determines the national champions of NCAA Division I men\\'s college basketball.\\n\\nMost U.S. states also crown state champions among their high schools. Many high school basketball teams have intense local followings, especially in the Midwest and Upper South.> Indiana has 10 of the 12 largest high school gyms in the United States, and is famous for its basketball passion, known as Hoosier Hysteria.\\n\\nNotable NBA players in history include Wilt Chamberlain (4 time MVP), Bill Russell (5 time MVP), Bob Pettit (11 time all NBA team), Bob Cousy (12 time all NBA team), Jerry West (12 time all NBA team), Julius Erving (won MVP awards in both the ABA and NBA), Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (6 time MVP), Magic Johnson (3 time MVP), Larry Bird (3 time MVP), Michael Jordan (6 time finals MVP), John Stockton (#1 in career assists and steals), Karl Malone (14 time all NBA team), Kobe Bryant (NBA\\'s third all-time leading scorer), Tim Duncan (15-time NBA all-star), Shaquille O\\'Neal (3 time finals MVP) and Jason Kidd (#2 in career assists and steals).\\n\\nNotable players in the NBA today include James Harden, LeBron James (4 MVP awards), Stephen Curry (2 time MVP), and Kevin Durant (MVP, 4 NBA scoring titles). Ever since the 1990s, an increasing number of players born outside the United States have signed with NBA teams, sparking league interest in different parts of the world.\\n\\nProfessional basketball is most followed in cities where there are no other sports teams in the four major professional leagues, such as in the case of the Oklahoma City Thunder, the Sacramento Kings, the San Antonio Spurs, the Memphis Grizzlies, or the Portland Trail Blazers. New York City has also had a long historical connection with college and professional basketball, and many basketball legends initially developed their reputations playing in the many playgrounds throughout the city. Madison Square Garden, the home arena of the New York Knicks, is often referred to as the \"Mecca of basketball.\"\\n\\nMinor league basketball, both official and unofficial, has an extensive presence, given the sport\\'s relative lack of expense to operate a professional team. The NBA has an official minor league, known since 2017 as the NBA G League under a naming rights agreement with Gatorade. The most prominent independent league is BIG3, a three-on-three league featuring former NBA stars that launched in 2017. Several other pro basketball leagues exist but are notorious for their instability and low budget operations.\\n\\nThe WNBA is the premier women\\'s basketball league in the United States as well as the most stable and sustained women\\'s professional sports league in the nation. Several of the 12 teams are owned by NBA teams. The women\\'s national team has won eight Olympic gold medals and 10 FIBA World Cups. Historically, women\\'s basketball in the United States followed a six-woman-per-team format in which three players on each team stayed on the same side of the court throughout the game. The six-person variant was abolished for college play in 1971, and over the course of the 1970s and 1980s was steadily abolished at the high school level, with the last states still sanctioning it switching girls over to the men\\'s five-on-five code in the mid-1990s.\\n\\nBaloncesto Superior Nacional and Baloncesto Superior Nacional Femenino are professional basketball leagues in Puerto Rico.\\n\\nIce hockey\\n\\nIce hockey, usually referred to in the U.S. simply as \"hockey\", is another popular sport in the United States. In the U.S. the game is most popular in regions of the country with a cold winter climate, namely the northeast and the upper Midwest. However, since the 1990s, hockey has become increasingly popular in the Sun Belt due in large part to the expansion of the National Hockey League to the southern U.S., coupled with the mass relocation of many residents from northern cities with strong hockey support to these Sun Belt locations.\\n\\nThe NHL is the major professional hockey league in North America, with 25 U.S.-based teams and 7 Canadian-based teams competing for the Stanley Cup. While NHL stars are still not as readily familiar to the general American public as are stars of the NFL, MLB, and the NBA, average attendance for NHL games in the U.S. has surpassed average NBA attendance in recent seasons, buoyed in part by the NHL Winter Classic being played in large outdoor stadiums.\\n\\nMinor league professional hockey leagues in the U.S. include the American Hockey League and the ECHL. Additionally, nine U.S.-based teams compete in the three member leagues of the Canadian Hockey League, a \"junior\" league for players aged sixteen to twenty. College hockey has a regional following in the northeastern and upper midwestern United States. It is increasingly being used to develop players for the NHL and other professional leagues (the U.S. has junior leagues, the United States Hockey League and North American Hockey League, but they are more restricted to protect junior players\\' college eligibility). The Frozen Four is college hockey\\'s national championship. The U.S. now has more youth hockey players than all other countries, excluding Canada, combined. USA Hockey is the official governing body for amateur hockey in the United States. The United States Hockey Hall of Fame is located in Eveleth, Minnesota.\\n\\nInternationally, the United States is counted among the Big Six, the group of nations that have historically dominated international ice hockey competition. (The others include Canada, Finland, Sweden, the Czech Republic, and Russia.) One of the nation\\'s greatest ever sporting moments was the \"Miracle on Ice\", which came during the 1980 Winter Olympics when the U.S. hockey team beat the Soviet Union 4–3 in the first game of the medal round before going on to beat Finland to claim the gold medal.\\n\\nHistorically, the vast majority of NHL players had come from Canada, with a small number of Americans. As late as 1969–70, Canadian players made up 95 percent of the league. During the 1970s and 1980s, European players entered the league, and many players from the former Soviet bloc flocked to the NHL beginning in the 1990s. Today, slightly less than half of NHL players are Canadian, more than 30% are Americans, and virtually all of the remainder are European-trained. (For a more complete discussion, see Origin of NHL players.)\\n\\nNotable NHL players in history include Wayne Gretzky (leading all-time point scorer and 9 time MVP), Mario Lemieux (3 time MVP), Guy Lafleur (2 time MVP),  Gordie Howe (6 time MVP), Nicklas Lidström (7 times NHL\\'s top defenseman), Bobby Hull (3 time MVP and 7 time leading goal scorer, Eddie Shore (4 time MVP), Howie Morenz (3 time MVP), Maurice \"Rocket\" Richard (5 time leading goal scorer), Jean Beliveau (2 time MVP), Bobby Clarke (3 time MVP), and Bobby Orr (8 times NHL\\'s best defenseman). Famous NHL players today include Sidney Crosby and Alexander Ovechkin.\\n\\nThe National Women\\'s Hockey League, founded in 2015, is the first women\\'s ice hockey league in the country to pay its players and features five teams in the northeast and upper midwest, plus one Canadian team. Three of the five U.S.-based teams (the Buffalo Beauts, Minnesota Whitecaps and Metropolitan Riveters) are either owned or operated by, or affiliated with, their metro area\\'s NHL franchise (the Buffalo Sabres, Minnesota Wild and New Jersey Devils, respectively). At the international level, the United States women\\'s national ice hockey team is one of the two predominant international women\\'s teams in the world, alongside its longtime rival Team Canada.\\n\\nSoccer\\n\\nSoccer has been increasing in popularity in the United States in recent years. Soccer is played by over 13 million people in the U.S., making it the third-most played sport in the U.S., more widely played than ice hockey and football. Most NCAA Division I colleges field both a men\\'s and women\\'s varsity soccer team, and those that field only one team almost invariably field a women\\'s team.\\n\\nThe United States men\\'s national team and women\\'s national team, as well as a number of national youth teams, represent the United States in international soccer competitions and are governed by the United States Soccer Federation (U.S. Soccer). The U.S. women\\'s team holds the record for most Women\\'s World Cup championships, and is the only team that has never finished worse than third place in a World Cup.\\nThe U.S. women beat the Netherlands 2–0 in the 2019 FIFA Women\\'s World Cup final to claim their second consecutive Women\\'s World Cup title, and fourth overall.\\n\\nMajor League Soccer is the premier soccer league in the United States. As of its ongoing 2021 season, MLS has 27 clubs (24 from the U.S. and 3 from Canada). The league plans to expand to 28 teams in 2022 and 30 in 2023. The 34-game schedule runs from mid-March to late October, with the playoffs and championship in November. Soccer-specific stadiums continue to be built for MLS teams around the country, both because football stadiums are considered to have excessive capacity, and because teams profit from operating their stadiums. With an average attendance of over 21,000 per game, MLS has the third-highest average attendance of any sports league in the U.S. after the National Football League (NFL) and Major League Baseball (MLB), and is the ninth-highest attended professional soccer league worldwide. Other professional men\\'s soccer leagues in the U.S. include the current second division, the USL Championship (USLC) and the third-level USL League One (USL1), which launched in 2019 under the auspices of the USLC\\'s operator, the United Soccer League. Another competition, the second North American Soccer League, had been the second-level league until being demoted in 2018 due to instability, and soon effectively folded. The USL organization now has a formal relationship with MLS, and a number of its teams (both in the Championship and League One) are either owned by or affiliated with MLS sides.\\n\\nYounger generations of Americans have strong fan appreciation for the sport, due to factors such as the U.S. hosting of the 1994 FIFA World Cup and the formation of Major League Soccer, as well as increased U.S. television coverage of soccer competitions. Many immigrants living in the United States continue to follow soccer as their favorite team sport. United States will host the 2026 FIFA World Cup, sharing with Canada and Mexico.\\n\\nWomen\\'s professional soccer in the United States has not seen sustained success. Following the demise of two professional leagues in the early 21st century, the Women\\'s United Soccer Association (1999–2001) and Women\\'s Professional Soccer (2009–2011), U.S. Soccer established a new National Women\\'s Soccer League in 2013. The NWSL has now survived longer than both of its two professional predecessors combined. Of its current 10 teams, six share ownership with professional men\\'s clubs—three are wholly owned by MLS team owners, two are wholly owned by USL sides (one each in the USLC and USL1), and another is primarily owned by a French Ligue 1 side. Two more teams are set to join the league in 2022. However, at the lower levels of the salary scale, the NWSL is effectively semi-professional.\\n\\nMany notable international soccer players played in the U.S. in the original North American Soccer League, usually at the end of their playing careers—including Pelé, Eusébio, George Best, Franz Beckenbauer, and Johan Cruyff—or in MLS—including Roberto Donadoni, Lothar Matthäus, David Beckham, Thierry Henry, Kaká, David Villa, Wayne Rooney, and Zlatan Ibrahimović. The best American soccer players enter the U.S. Soccer Hall of Fame.\\n\\nThe Major Arena Soccer League (MASL) is a North American professional indoor soccer league. MASL is the highest level of arena soccer in the North America and the world.\\n\\nOther team sports\\n\\nOverview\\nThe following table shows additional sports that are played by over 500,000 people in the United States.\\n\\n Attendance record measures highest single-game attendances. Attendance records are: Volleyball: 2017 NCAA Division I women\\'s championship final; Ultimate: 2014 Montreal Royal (AUDL); Rugby: 2014 New Zealand vs. Ireland in Chicago; and Lacrosse: 2007 NCAA Division I men\\'s championship semifinals.\\n TV viewership records are: Volleyball: 2010 NCAA women\\'s championship on ESPN2; Rugby: 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens on NBC; Lacrosse: 2016 NCAA championship on ESPN2; Ultimate: 2017 US Open Mixed final.\\n\\nLacrosse\\n\\nLacrosse is a team sport that is believed to have originated with the Iroquois and the Lenape. The sport is most popular in the East Coast area from Maryland to New York. While its roots remain east, lacrosse is currently the fastest growing sport in the nation. The National Lacrosse League is the professional Box lacrosse league, while the Premier Lacrosse League is the professional Field Lacrosse league. Major League Lacrosse was a semi-professional Field Lacrosse league that was operating nationally before merging into PLL in 2020.\\n\\nVolleyball\\n\\nVolleyball is played in the United States, especially at the college and university levels. Unlike most Olympic sports which are sponsored widely at the collegiate level for both sexes, the women\\'s college volleyball teams are more common than men\\'s college volleyball teams. In the 2011–12 school year, over 300 schools in NCAA Division I alone (the highest of three NCAA tiers) sponsored women\\'s volleyball at the varsity level, while fewer than 100 schools in all three NCAA divisions combined sponsored varsity men\\'s volleyball, with only 23 of them in Division I. Men\\'s volleyball has grown at the non-scholarship NCAA Division III level in the 21st century, with a national championship established in 2012. As of the 2021 season (2020–21 school year), 107 schools sponsor the sport at that level.\\n\\nAs of 2019, there are currently two leagues that branch across the United States. First of these is the National Volleyball Association (NVA). The NVA currently has 10 teams. The second league is the Volleyball League Of America (VLA) and has 5 teams spread across the United States.\\n\\nThe men\\'s national team has won three gold medals at the Olympic Games, one FIVB World Championship, two FIVB Volleyball World Cup, and one FIVB World League. Meanwhile, the women\\'s national team has won one FIVB World Championship and six editions of the FIVB World Grand Prix.\\n\\nBeach volleyball has increasingly become popular in the United States, in part due to media exposure during the Olympic Games. Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP) is the biggest and longest-running professional beach volleyball tour in the United States.\\n\\nRugby union\\n\\nRugby union usually referred to in the U.S. simply as \"rugby\" is played professionally (Major League Rugby), recreationally and in colleges, though it is not governed by the NCAA (see college rugby). An estimated 1.2 million people in the United States play rugby. The U.S. national team has competed at the Rugby World Cup. In rugby sevens, the men\\'s national team is one of 15 \"core teams\" that participate in every event of the annual World Rugby Sevens Series, and the women\\'s national team is one of 11 core teams in the Women\\'s Sevens Series. Major League Rugby, a professional domestic club competition, has been played since 2018.\\n\\nRugby union participation in the U.S. has grown significantly in recent years, growing by 350% between 2004 and 2011. A 2010 survey by the National Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association ranked rugby union as the fastest-growing sport in the U.S. The sports profile in the U.S. has received a tremendous boost from the IOC\\'s announcement in 2009 that rugby union (in its seven-a-side variant) would return to the Olympics in 2016. Since the Olympic announcement, rugby union events such as the Collegiate Rugby Championship, the USA Sevens, and the Rugby World Cup have been broadcast on network TV. The USA Sevens, held every year in February or March as part of the World Rugby Sevens Series, has regularly drawn more than 60,000 fans to Sam Boyd Stadium in Las Vegas, though the tournament will move to the Los Angeles area for at least its 2020 edition. The U.S. also hosts an event in the Women\\'s Sevens Series. It had been held alongside the USA Sevens in the 2016–17 season, but was not held in 2017–18 (when the Rugby World Cup Sevens for both men and women was held in San Francisco). The USA Women\\'s Sevens returned in 2018, after the World Cup Sevens, but is now a standalone event held in the Denver area that serves as the Women\\'s World Series opener.\\n\\nRugby union is the fastest growing college sport and sport in general in the United States.\\n\\nRugby football formed the basis of modern American football; the two sports were nearly identical in the late 19th century but diverged into distinct, incompatible codes by the start of the 20th century.\\n\\nCricket\\n\\nIn 2006 it was estimated that 30,000 people in the United States play or watch cricket annually. By 2017, this figure had risen to 200,000 people playing cricket in 6,000 teams. Cricket in the United States is not as popular as baseball and is not as popular among as large a fraction of the population as it is\\nwithin either the Commonwealth nations or the other ICC full member (or Test cricket) nations. There are at least two historical reasons for the relative obscurity of cricket within\\nthe United States. One reason was the 19th-century-rise of the summer time bat and ball sport now called baseball, which has displaced cricket as a popular pastime. Another reason was that in 1909 when the ICC was originally organized as the\\nImperial Cricket Conference it was open only to Commonwealth nations and thereby excluded the US from participating in the sport at the highest level.\\n\\nNevertheless, in 1965 the US was admitted to the renamed ICC as an associate member and the sport grew in popularity in the second half of the 20th century. An oft mentioned reason for the growing popularity of cricket is the growing population of immigrants to the US who come from cricket playing nations.\\n\\nWith the launching of the United States Youth Cricket Association in 2010, a more focused effort to bring the game to American schools was begun, with the intention of broadening cricket\\'s fan base beyond expatriates and their children.\\n\\nESPN has been stepping up its coverage of cricket in recent years, buying the cricket website Cricinfo in 2007, and broadcasting the final of the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 competition, the 2014 Indian Premier League, English County Championship games, and international Test cricket.\\n\\nIn 2021, Minor League Cricket, a professional Twenty20 cricket league sanctioned by USA Cricket, began play. Major League Cricket is planning to launch its first season in 2023. In addition, various championships and pathways are being offered for youth cricketers, such as the MLC Jr. Championship.\\n\\nUltimate and disc sports \\n\\nUltimate is a team sport played with a flying disc. The object of the game is to score points by passing the disc to members of your own team until you have completed a pass to a team member in the opposing team\\'s end zone. Over 5.1 million people play some form of organized ultimate in the US.\\n\\nAlternative sports, using the flying disc, began in the mid-sixties, when numbers of young people looked for alternative recreational activities, including throwing a Frisbee. What started with a few players experimenting with a Frisbee later would become known as playing disc freestyle. Organized disc sports in the 1970s began with a few tournaments, and professionals using Frisbee show tours to perform at universities, fairs and sporting events. Disc sports such as disc freestyle, disc dog (with a human handler throwing discs for a dog to catch), double disc court, disc guts, disc ultimate, and disc golf became this sport\\'s first events.  More-proprietary disc games include KanJam, akin to quoits, invented in Buffalo, New York in the 1980s.\\n\\nBeginning in 1974, the International Frisbee Disc Association became the regulatory organization for all of these sports. Led from 1975–1982 by Dan \"Stork\" Roddick, who also served as sports-marketing head for Wham-O, the IFA created an annual tournament at the Rose Bowl called the World Frisbee Championship, which drew over 50,000 fans and live TV coverage.  This tournament served as a focal point for the more-developed game of Disc guts, invented in the 1950s, and the emerging popularity  freestyle competition (1974) and disc golf (standardized in 1976 by the Professional Disc Golf Association).\\n\\nAround the same time, high school students at Columbia HS in Maplewood NJ invented a disc game in 1968 that they called Ultimate.  Among the three credited with its invention was future hollywood producer Joel Silver.  Spread to mostly East Coast colleges by Columbia HS graduates in the early 1970s, and developed nearly in parallel in Southern California, the game began to have unofficial championships played in 1975.  Loosely organized in its early years, Ultimate developed as an organized sport with the 1979 creation of the Ultimate Players Association.  The sport grew rapidly throughout the country, establishing a Women\\'s division in 1981, splitting its College division from the Club (adult) division in 1984, a Mixed Club division in 1997, and Youth championships from 1998.  In 2010, the UPA re-branded as USA Ultimate, to be more in-line with other sports governing bodies.\\n\\nAs club, college and youth play continued to expand rapidly, more-entrepreneurial enthusiasts looked to turn player interest into spectator dollars.  In 2012, the American Ultimate Disc League became the first professional Ultimate league, followed the next year by Major League Ultimate.  The two ran in parallel through 2016, when MLU folded; AUDL has sustained play through 2019 and expanded from 8 teams in 2012 to 21 teams in 2019.  Although the AUDL\\'s popularity continues to grow, the USA Ultimate Club Division is still viewed as the sport\\'s highest level of play.\\n\\nIn 2015, the International Olympic Committee granted full recognition to the World Flying Disc Federation for flying disc sports including Ultimate.\\n\\nOther sports\\n\\nThe development of snowboarding was inspired by skateboarding, sledding, surfing and skiing. It was developed in the United States in the 1960s, became a Winter Olympic Sport at Nagano in 1998 and first featured in the Winter Paralympics at Sochi in 2014.\\n\\nAustralian rules football in the United States was first played in the country in 1996. The United States Australian Football League is the governing body for the sport in the U.S, with various clubs and leagues around the country. The National Championships are held annually. The United States men\\'s national Australian rules football team and the women\\'s national team both regularly play international matches, and play in the Australian Football International Cup, an international tournament. The sport also benefits from an active fan based organization, the Australian Football Association of North America.\\n\\nBandy is only played in Minnesota. The national team regularly plays in Division A of the Bandy World Championships. In terms of licensed athletes, it is the second biggest winter sport in the world.\\n\\nCricket in the United States is not a popular sport, but has a niche market with limited inroads, mainly in immigrant communities. The United States of America Cricket Association governs cricket in the United States.\\n\\nCricket used to be the most popular sport in America during the 18th and early 19th centuries, but declined as baseball overtook cricket. The first intercollegiate tournament in America was the first annual Canada vs. U.S. cricket match, played since 1844, when it was attended by 10,000 spectators in New York., and the annual match is the oldest international sporting event in the modern world.\\nThe United States national cricket team plays in World Cricket League Division IV, the ICC Americas Championship and qualified for ICC Intercontinental Cup.\\n\\nCurling is popular in northern states, possibly because of climate, proximity to Canada, or Scandinavian heritage. The national popularity of curling is growing after significant media coverage of the sport in the 2006 and 2010 Winter Olympics.\\n\\nGaelic football and hurling are governed by North American GAA and New York GAA. They do not have a high profile but are developing sports, with New York fielding a representative team in the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship.\\n\\nField hockey is played in the United States predominantly by women. It is played widely at numerous NCAA colleges.\\n\\nHandball, a common popular sport in European countries, is seldom seen in the United States. The sport is mostly played in the country on the amateur level. Handball is played in the Summer Olympics, but is not sanctioned by the NCAA; all college and university teams play as club teams. In 2020, a former USA Team Handball CEO Barry Siff said that they are planning to create an American professional team handball league sponsored by Verizon. They are planning to have the owners until the end of 2020, and to launch the league in 2023 with 10 teams with each team initially worth $3 million to $5 million and want to cooperate with NBA or NHL owners in one-tenant arena situations.\\n\\nInline hockey was invented by Americans as a way to play the sport in all climates. The PIHA is the league with the largest number of professional teams in the nation. Street hockey is a non-standard version of inline hockey played by amateurs in informal games.\\n\\nRugby league in the United States is played by the USA Rugby League (USARL) is a 14 team semi-professional rugby league football competition based on the East Coast of the United States. The league was founded in 2011 by clubs that had broken with the established American National Rugby League (AMNRL), plus expansion franchises. The USARL began its inaugural season in 2011. In November 2014, the USARL were granted Affiliate membership of the RLIF and RLEF and are now the official governing body for the sport in the United States. The United States national rugby league team played in their first World Cup in 2013 losing to Australia in the quarter finals 62–0. The United States, along with Canada, will host the 2025 Rugby League World Cup.\\nNorth American Rugby League is a professional rugby league league founded in 2021.\\n\\nWater polo does not have a professional competition in the U.S., so the highest level of competitive play is at the college level and in the Olympics. The NCAA sanctions water polo as a varsity sport for both men and women, and is popular in the U.S. along the west coast, and parts of the east coast. However, no team outside of California has ever reached the finals of the NCAA Division I men\\'s water polo championship.\\n\\nOrganization of American sports\\n\\nProfessional sports\\n\\nFor the most part, unlike sports in Europe and other parts of the world, there is no system of promotion and relegation in American professional sports. Major sports leagues operate as associations of franchises. The same 30–32 teams play in the league each year unless they move to another city or the league chooses to expand with new franchises.\\n\\nAll American sports leagues use the same type of schedule. After the regular season, the 10–16 teams with the best records enter a playoff tournament leading to a championship series or game. American sports, except for soccer and women\\'s basketball, have no equivalent to the cup competitions that run concurrently with leagues in European sports. In soccer, the cup competition, the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, draws considerably less attention than the regular season. In basketball, the WNBA launched the Commissioner\\'s Cup in the 2021 season, but the qualification process for the one-off Cup final, held at midseason, is based on a subset of regular-season games for all teams. Also, the only top-level U.S. professional teams that play teams from other organizations in meaningful games are those in MLS. Since the 2012 season, all U.S.-based MLS teams have automatically qualified for the U.S. Open Cup, in which they compete against teams from lower-level U.S. leagues. In addition, three or four U.S.-based MLS teams (depending on the results of the U.S. Open Cup) qualify to play clubs from countries outside the U.S. and Canada in the CONCACAF Champions League. NBA teams have played European teams in preseason exhibitions on a semi-regular basis, and recent MLS All-Star Games have pitted top players from the league against major European soccer teams, such as members of the Premier League.\\n\\nInternational competition is not as important in American sports as it is in the sporting culture of most other countries, although Olympic ice hockey and basketball tournaments do generate attention. The first international baseball tournament with top-level players, the World Baseball Classic, also generated some positive reviews after its inaugural tournament in 2006.\\n\\nThe major professional sports leagues operate drafts once a year, in which each league\\'s teams selected eligible prospects. Eligibility differs from league to league. Baseball and ice hockey operate minor league systems for players who have finished education but are not ready or good enough for the major leagues. The NBA also has a development league for players who are not ready to play at the top level.\\n\\nCollege sports\\n\\nThe extent to which sports are associated with secondary and tertiary education in the United States is rare among nations. Millions of students participate in athletics programs operated by high schools and colleges. Student-athletes often receive scholarships to colleges in recognition of their athletic potential. Currently, the largest governing body of collegiate sports is the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).\\n\\nEspecially in football and basketball, college sports are followed in numbers equaling those of professional sports. College football games can draw over 100,000 spectators. For upper-tier institutions, sports are a significant source of revenue; for less prominent teams, maintaining a high-level team is a major expense. To ensure some semblance of competitive balance, the NCAA divides its institutions into three divisions (four in football), sorted by the number of athletic scholarships each school is willing to offer.\\n\\nThe most practiced college sports, measured by NCAA reporting on varsity team participation, are: (1) football (64,000), (2) baseball/softball (47,000), (3) track and field (46,000), (4) soccer (43,000), (5) basketball (32,000), (6) cross-country running (25,000), and (7) swimming/diving (20,000). The most popular sport among female athletes is soccer, followed closely by track and field.\\n\\nCommunity college athletics are governed separately by the National Junior College Athletic Association (NJCAA).\\n\\nHigh school sports\\n\\nMost public high schools are members of their respective state athletic association, and those associations are members of the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). Some states have separate associations for public and non-public high schools.\\n\\nThe 2018–19 school year was the first in 30 years to see a decrease in high school sports participation. Increases through the previous decades had been largely driven by growth in girls\\' participation. The high school sports with the highest number of participants for 2018–19 are:\\n\\nTeam sports\\n Football – 1,008,417\\n Basketball – 939,836\\n Baseball/Softball – 854,859\\n Soccer – 853,182\\n Volleyball – 516,371\\n\\nIndividual sports\\n Track & field (outdoor) – 1,093,621\\n Cross country – 488,640\\n Tennis – 348,750\\n Swimming & diving – 309,726\\n Wrestling – 268,565\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nPopular high school sports in various regions of the U.S. include the Texas High School football championships, the Indiana basketball championships, and ice hockey in Minnesota.\\nThe Minnesota State High School Hockey Tournament is the largest high school sporting event in the country, with average attendance to the top tier, or \"AA\", games over 18,000.\\n\\nAmateur sports\\n\\nThe Amateur Athletic Union claims to have over 670,000 participants and over 100,000 volunteers.. The AAU has existed since 1888, and has been influential in amateur sports for that same time span.\\n\\nIn the 1970s, the AAU received growing criticism. Many claimed that its regulatory framework was outdated. Women were banned from participating in certain competitions and some runners were locked out.  There were also problems with sporting goods that did not meet the standards of the AAU. During this time, the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 organized the United States Olympic Committee and saw the re-establishment of state-supported independent associations for the Olympic sports, referred to as national governing bodies. As a result, the AAU lost its influence and importance in international sports, and focused on the support and promotion of predominantly youthful athletes, as well as on the organization of national sports events.\\n\\nGovernment regulation\\n\\nNo American government agency is charged with overseeing sports. However, the President\\'s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports advises the President through the Secretary of Health and Human Services about physical activity, fitness, and sports, and recommends programs to promote regular physical activity for the health of all Americans.The U.S. Congress has chartered the United States Olympic Committee to govern American participation in the Olympic Movement and promote Olympic sports. Congress has also involved itself in several aspects of sports, notably gender equity in college athletics, illegal drugs in pro sports, sports broadcasting and the application of antitrust law to sports leagues.\\n\\nIndividual states may also have athletic commissions, which primarily govern individual sports such as boxing, kickboxing and mixed martial arts. Notable state athletic commissions are the Nevada Athletic Commission, California State Athletic Commission, New York State Athletic Commission and New Jersey State Athletic Control Board. Although these commissions only have jurisdiction over their own states, the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution is often interpreted as forcing all other states to recognize any state athletic commission\\'s rulings regarding an athlete\\'s fitness for participating in a sport.\\n\\nSports media in the United States\\n\\nSports have been a major part of American broadcasting since the early days of radio. ESPN, the first all-sports cable network in the U.S., went on the air in 1979. It has been followed by several sister networks and competitors.  Some sports television networks are national, such as CBS Sports Network, Fox Sports 1 and NBC Sports Network, whereas others are regional, such as NBC Sports Regional Networks, Fox Sports Networks and Spectrum Sports. General entertainment channels like TBS, TNT, and USA Network also air sports events.\\nSome sports leagues have their own sports networks, such as NFL Network, MLB Network, NBA TV, NHL Network, Big Ten Network, Pac-12 Network and SEC Network. Some sports teams run their own television networks as well.\\n\\nSports are also widely broadcast at the local level, ranging from college and professional sports down to (on some smaller stations) recreational and youth leagues. Internet radio has allowed these broadcasts to reach a worldwide audience.\\n\\nMost popular sports in the United States\\n\\nIn the broadest definition of sports—physical recreation of all sorts—the four most popular sports among the general population of the United States are exercise walking (90 million), exercising with equipment (53 million), swimming (52 million) and camping (47 million). The most popular competitive sport (and fifth most popular recreational sport) is bowling (43 million). Other most popular sports are fishing (35 million), bicycling (37 million), weightlifting (33 million), aerobics (30 million), and hiking (28 million).\\n\\nAccording to a January 2018 Poll by Gallup, 37% of Americans consider football their favorite spectator sport, while 11% prefer basketball, 9% baseball, and 7% soccer. There is some variation by viewer demographics. Men, show a stronger preference for football than women, conservatives a stronger preference than liberals, and those over 35 a stronger preference than those under 35. In all groups, however, football is still the most popular. Basketball and soccer are more popular among liberals than conservatives.\\n\\nSports leagues in the United States\\n\\nThe sports leagues\\nThe following table shows the professional sports leagues, which average over 15,000 fans per game and that have a national TV contract that pays rights fees.\\n\\nOther team sports leagues\\n\\n American Ultimate Disc League (AUDL)\\n National Volleyball Association (NVA)\\n Association of Volleyball Professionals (AVP)\\n National Women\\'s Soccer League (NWSL)\\n Major Arena Soccer League (MASL)\\n United Soccer League (USL)\\n USL Championship (USLC)\\n USL League One (USL1)\\n USL League Two (USL2)\\n National Independent Soccer Association (NISA)\\n Major League Lacrosse (MLL)\\n Premier Lacrosse League (PLL)\\n National Lacrosse League (NLL)\\n International League (IL)\\n Pacific Coast League (PCL)\\n Eastern League\\n Texas League\\n Southern League\\n California League\\n Carolina League\\n Florida State League (FSL)\\n Major League Rugby (MLR)\\n USA Rugby League (USARL)\\n National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)\\n National Women\\'s Hockey League (NWHL)\\n American Hockey League (AHL)\\n ECHL \\n Federal Prospects Hockey League (FPHL)\\n Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL)\\n National Pro Fastpitch (NPF)\\n United States Australian Football League (USAFL)\\n Professional Inline Hockey Association (PIHA)\\n Women\\'s National Basketball Association (WNBA)\\n NBA G League\\n USFL\\n XFL\\n National Gay Flag Football League (NGFFL)\\n Women\\'s Football Alliance (WFA)\\n Major League Cricket (MLC)\\n\\nOther individual sports leagues\\n\\n Bellator Fighting Championships\\n IndyCar (was Indy Racing League (IRL), merged with Champ Car)\\n International Motor Sports Association (IMSA, sanctions IMSA SportsCar Championship)\\n Legends Tour, for women\\'s golfers 45 and over\\n LPGA Tour\\n Symetra Tour, developmental tour for the LPGA\\n National Association of Stock Car Automobile Racing (NASCAR)\\n National Hot Rod Association (NHRA)\\n PBA Tour\\n Professional Bull Riders (PBR)\\n Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association (PRCA)\\n PGA Tour\\n PGA Tour Champions, for men\\'s golfers 50 and over; operated by the PGA Tour\\n Korn Ferry Tour, developmental tour for the PGA Tour\\n Professional Disc Golf Association (PDGA)\\n Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)\\n United States Bowling Congress (USBC)\\n World Juggling Federation (WJF)\\n\\nSports governing bodies\\n\\n USA Boxing (USAB)\\n USA Basketball (USAB)\\n USA Cycling (USAC)\\n USA Cricket (USAC)\\n USA Football (USAF)\\n USA Baseball (USAB)\\n USA Hockey (USAH)\\n USA Rugby (USAR)\\n USA Table Tennis (USATT)\\n USA Team Handball (USATH)\\n USA Track & Field (USATF)\\n USA Volleyball (USAV)\\n United States Aquatic Sports (USAS)\\n United States Bobsled and Skeleton Federation (USBFS)\\n United States Golf Association (USGA)\\n United States Ski and Snowboard \\n United States Snooker Association (USSA)\\n United States Soccer Federation (USSF)\\n United States Tennis Association (USTA)\\n\\nSee also\\n Sports in the United States by state\\n Sports Museum of America\\n Professional sports in the Western United States\\n Record attendances in United States club soccer\\n Homosexuality in sports in the United States\\n Sport in the United Kingdom\\n\\nNotes\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nFurther reading \\n Gerdy, John R.

Simulations require the use of models; the model represents the key characteristics or behaviors of the selected system or process, whereas the simulation represents the evolution of the model over time. Often, computers are used to execute the simulation.\\n\\nSimulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance tuning or optimizing, safety engineering, testing, training, education, and video games. Simulation is also used with scientific modelling of natural systems or human systems to gain insight into their functioning, as in economics. Simulation can be used to show the eventual real effects of alternative conditions and courses of action. Simulation is also used when the real system cannot be engaged, because it may not be accessible, or it may be dangerous or unacceptable to engage, or it is being designed but not yet built, or it may simply not exist.\\n\\nKey issues in modeling and simulation include the acquisition of valid sources of information about the relevant selection of key characteristics and behaviors used to build the model, the use of simplifying approximations and assumptions within the model, and fidelity and validity of the simulation outcomes. Procedures and protocols for model verification and validation are an ongoing field of academic study, refinement, research and development in simulations technology or practice, particularly in the work of computer simulation.\\n\\nClassification and terminology\\n\\nHistorically, simulations used in different fields developed largely independently, but 20th-century studies of systems theory and cybernetics combined with spreading use of computers across all those fields have led to some unification and a more systematic view of the concept.\\n\\nPhysical simulation refers to simulation in which physical objects are substituted for the real thing (some circles use the term for computer simulations modelling selected laws of physics, but this article does not). These physical objects are often chosen because they are smaller or cheaper than the actual object or system.\\n\\nInteractive simulation is a special kind of physical simulation, often referred to as a human-in-the-loop simulation, in which physical simulations include human operators, such as in a flight simulator, sailing simulator, or driving simulator.\\n\\nContinuous simulation is a simulation based on continuous-time rather than discrete-time steps, using numerical integration of differential equations.\\n\\nDiscrete-event simulation studies systems whose states change their values only at discrete times. For example, a simulation of an epidemic could change the number of infected people at time instants when susceptible individuals get infected or when infected individuals recover.\\n\\nStochastic simulation is a simulation where some variable or process is subject to random variations and is projected using Monte Carlo techniques using pseudo-random numbers. Thus replicated runs with the same boundary conditions will each produce different results within a specific confidence band.\\n\\nDeterministic simulation is a simulation which is not stochastic: thus the variables are regulated by deterministic algorithms. So replicated runs from the same boundary conditions always produce identical results.\\n\\nHybrid simulation (or combined simulation) corresponds to a mix between continuous and discrete event simulation and results in integrating numerically the differential equations between two sequential events to reduce the number of discontinuities.\\n\\nA stand-alone simulation is a simulation running on a single workstation by itself.\\n\\nA  is one which uses more than one computer simultaneously, to guarantee access from/to different resources (e.g. multi-users operating different systems, or distributed data sets); a classical example is Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS).\\n\\nParallel simulation speeds up a simulation\\'s execution by concurrently distributing its workload over multiple processors, as in High-Performance Computing.\\n\\nInteroperable simulation is where multiple models, simulators (often defined as federates) interoperate locally, distributed over a network; a classical example is High-Level Architecture.\\n\\nModeling and simulation as a service is where simulation is accessed as a service over the web.\\n\\nModeling, interoperable simulation and serious games is where serious game approaches (e.g. game engines and engagement methods) are integrated with interoperable simulation.\\n\\nSimulation fidelity is used to describe the accuracy of a simulation and how closely it imitates the real-life counterpart. Fidelity is broadly classified as one of three categories: low, medium, and high. Specific descriptions of fidelity levels are subject to interpretation, but the following generalizations can be made:\\n Low – the minimum simulation required for a system to respond to accept inputs and provide outputs\\n Medium – responds automatically to stimuli, with limited accuracy\\n High – nearly indistinguishable or as close as possible to the real system\\n\\nA synthetic environment is a computer simulation that can be included in human-in-the-loop simulations.\\n\\nSimulation in failure analysis refers to simulation in which we create environment/conditions to identify the cause of equipment failure. This can be the best and fastest method to identify the failure cause.\\n\\nComputer simulation\\n\\nA computer simulation (or \"sim\") is an attempt to model a real-life or hypothetical situation on a computer so that it can be studied to see how the system works. By changing variables in the simulation, predictions may be made about the behaviour of the system. It is a tool to virtually investigate the behaviour of the system under study.\\n\\nComputer simulation has become a useful part of modeling many natural systems in physics, chemistry and biology, and human systems in economics and social science (e.g., computational sociology) as well as in engineering to gain insight into the operation of those systems. A good example of the usefulness of using computers to simulate can be found in the field of network traffic simulation. In such simulations, the model behaviour will change each simulation according to the set of initial parameters assumed for the environment.\\n\\nTraditionally, the formal modeling of systems has been via a mathematical model, which attempts to find analytical solutions enabling the prediction of the behaviour of the system from a set of parameters and initial conditions. Computer simulation is often used as an adjunct to, or substitution for, modeling systems for which simple closed form analytic solutions are not possible. There are many different types of computer simulation, the common feature they all share is the attempt to generate a sample of representative scenarios for a model in which a complete enumeration of all possible states would be prohibitive or impossible.\\n\\nSeveral software packages exist for running computer-based simulation modeling (e.g. Monte Carlo simulation, stochastic modeling, multimethod modeling) that makes all the modeling almost effortless.\\n\\nModern usage of the term \"computer simulation\" may encompass virtually any computer-based representation.\\n\\nComputer science\\n\\nIn computer science, simulation has some specialized meanings: Alan Turing used the term simulation to refer to what happens when a universal machine executes a state transition table (in modern terminology, a computer runs a program) that describes the state transitions, inputs and outputs of a subject discrete-state machine. The computer simulates the subject machine. Accordingly, in theoretical computer science the term simulation is a relation between state transition systems, useful in the study of operational semantics.\\n\\nLess theoretically, an interesting application of computer simulation is to simulate computers using computers. In computer architecture, a type of simulator, typically called an emulator, is often used to execute a program that has to run on some inconvenient type of computer (for example, a newly designed computer that has not yet been built or an obsolete computer that is no longer available), or in a tightly controlled testing environment (see Computer architecture simulator and Platform virtualization). For example, simulators have been used to debug a microprogram or sometimes commercial application programs, before the program is downloaded to the target machine. Since the operation of the computer is simulated, all of the information about the computer\\'s operation is directly available to the programmer, and the speed and execution of the simulation can be varied at will.\\n\\nSimulators may also be used to interpret fault trees, or test VLSI logic designs before they are constructed. Symbolic simulation uses variables to stand for unknown values.\\n\\nIn the field of optimization, simulations of physical processes are often used in conjunction with evolutionary computation to optimize control strategies.\\n\\nSimulation in education and training\\n\\nSimulation is extensively used for educational purposes. It is used for cases where it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a \"safe\" virtual environment yet living a lifelike experience (or at least it is the goal). Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system.\\n\\nSimulations in education are somewhat like training simulations. They focus on specific tasks. The term \\'microworld\\' is used to refer to educational simulations which model some abstract concept rather than simulating a realistic object or environment, or in some cases model a real-world environment in a simplistic way so as to help a learner develop an understanding of the key concepts. Normally, a user can create some sort of construction within the microworld that will behave in a way consistent with the concepts being modeled. Seymour Papert was one of the first to advocate the value of microworlds, and the Logo programming environment developed by Papert is one of the most well-known microworlds.\\n\\nProject management simulation is increasingly used to train students and professionals in the art and science of project management. Using simulation for project management training improves learning retention and enhances the learning process.\\n\\nSocial simulations may be used in social science classrooms to illustrate social and political processes in anthropology, economics, history, political science, or sociology courses, typically at the high school or university level. These may, for example, take the form of civics simulations, in which participants assume roles in a simulated society, or international relations simulations in which participants engage in negotiations, alliance formation, trade, diplomacy, and the use of force. Such simulations might be based on fictitious political systems, or be based on current or historical events. An example of the latter would be Barnard College\\'s Reacting to the Past series of historical educational games. The National Science Foundation has also supported the creation of reacting games that address science and math education. In social media simulations, participants train communication with critics and other stakeholders in a private environment.\\n\\nIn recent years, there has been increasing use of social simulations for staff training in aid and development agencies. The Carana simulation, for example, was first developed by the United Nations Development Programme, and is now used in a very revised form by the World Bank for training staff to deal with fragile and conflict-affected countries.\\n\\nMilitary uses for simulation often involve aircraft or armoured fighting vehicles, but can also target small arms and other weapon systems training. Specifically, virtual firearms ranges have become the norm in most military training processes and there is a significant amount of data to suggest this is a useful tool for armed professionals.\\n\\nVirtual simulation\\nA virtual simulation is a category of simulation that uses simulation equipment to create a simulated world for the user. Virtual simulations allow users to interact with a virtual world. Virtual worlds operate on platforms of integrated software and hardware components. In this manner, the system can accept input from the user (e.g., body tracking, voice/sound recognition, physical controllers) and produce output to the user (e.g., visual display, aural display, haptic display) . Virtual simulations use the aforementioned modes of interaction to produce a sense of immersion for the user.\\n\\nVirtual simulation input hardware\\n\\nThere is a wide variety of input hardware available to accept user input for virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:\\n\\n Body tracking: The motion capture method is often used to record the user\\'s movements and translate the captured data into inputs for the virtual simulation. For example, if a user physically turns their head, the motion would be captured by the simulation hardware in some way and translated to a corresponding shift in view within the simulation.\\n Capture suits and/or gloves may be used to capture movements of users body parts. The systems may have sensors incorporated inside them to sense movements of different body parts (e.g., fingers). Alternatively, these systems may have exterior tracking devices or marks that can be detected by external ultrasound, optical receivers or electromagnetic sensors. Internal inertial sensors are also available on some systems. The units may transmit data either wirelessly or through cables.\\n Eye trackers can also be used to detect eye movements so that the system can determine precisely where a user is looking at any given instant.\\n Physical controllers: Physical controllers provide input to the simulation only through direct manipulation by the user. In virtual simulations, tactile feedback from physical controllers is highly desirable in a number of simulation environments.\\n Omnidirectional treadmills can be used to capture the users locomotion as they walk or run.\\n High fidelity instrumentation such as instrument panels in virtual aircraft cockpits provides users with actual controls to raise the level of immersion. For example, pilots can use the actual global positioning system controls from the real device in a simulated cockpit to help them practice procedures with the actual device in the context of the integrated cockpit system.\\n Voice/sound recognition: This form of interaction may be used either to interact with agents within the simulation (e.g., virtual people) or to manipulate objects in the simulation (e.g., information). Voice interaction presumably increases the level of immersion for the user.\\n Users may use headsets with boom microphones, lapel microphones or the room may be equipped with strategically located microphones.\\n\\nCurrent research into user input systems\\nResearch in future input systems holds a great deal of promise for virtual simulations. Systems such as brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) offer the ability to further increase the level of immersion for virtual simulation users. Lee, Keinrath, Scherer, Bischof, Pfurtscheller proved that naïve subjects could be trained to use a BCI to navigate a virtual apartment with relative ease. Using the BCI, the authors found that subjects were able to freely navigate the virtual environment with relatively minimal effort. It is possible that these types of systems will become standard input modalities in future virtual simulation systems.\\n\\nVirtual simulation output hardware\\nThere is a wide variety of output hardware available to deliver a stimulus to users in virtual simulations. The following list briefly describes several of them:\\n\\nVisual display: Visual displays provide the visual stimulus to the user.\\n Stationary displays can vary from a conventional desktop display to 360-degree wrap-around screens to stereo three-dimensional screens. Conventional desktop displays can vary in size from . Wrap around screens is typically used in what is known as a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE). Stereo three-dimensional screens produce three-dimensional images either with or without special glasses—depending on the design.\\n Head-mounted displays (HMDs) have small displays that are mounted on headgear worn by the user. These systems are connected directly into the virtual simulation to provide the user with a more immersive experience. Weight, update rates and field of view are some of the key variables that differentiate HMDs. Naturally, heavier HMDs are undesirable as they cause fatigue over time. If the update rate is too slow, the system is unable to update the displays fast enough to correspond with a quick head turn by the user. Slower update rates tend to cause simulation sickness and disrupt the sense of immersion. Field of view or the angular extent of the world that is seen at a given moment field of view can vary from system to system and has been found to affect the user\\'s sense of immersion.\\n Aural display: Several different types of audio systems exist to help the user hear and localize sounds spatially. Special software can be used to produce 3D audio effects 3D audio to create the illusion that sound sources are placed within a defined three-dimensional space around the user.\\n Stationary conventional speaker systems may be used to provide dual or multi-channel surround sound. However, external speakers are not as effective as headphones in producing 3D audio effects.\\n Conventional headphones offer a portable alternative to stationary speakers. They also have the added advantages of masking real-world noise and facilitate more effective 3D audio sound effects. \\n Haptic display: These displays provide a sense of touch to the user (haptic technology). This type of output is sometimes referred to as force feedback.\\n Tactile tile displays use different types of actuators such as inflatable bladders, vibrators, low-frequency sub-woofers, pin actuators and/or thermo-actuators to produce sensations for the user.\\n End effector displays can respond to users inputs with resistance and force. These systems are often used in medical applications for remote surgeries that employ robotic instruments.\\n Vestibular display: These displays provide a sense of motion to the user (motion simulator). They often manifest as motion bases for virtual vehicle simulation such as driving simulators or flight simulators. Motion bases are fixed in place but use actuators to move the simulator in ways that can produce the sensations pitching, yawing or rolling. The simulators can also move in such a way as to produce a sense of acceleration on all axes (e.g., the motion base can produce the sensation of falling).\\n\\nClinical healthcare simulators\\n\\nClinical healthcare simulators are increasingly being developed and deployed to teach therapeutic and diagnostic procedures as well as medical concepts and decision making to personnel in the health professions. Simulators have been developed for training procedures ranging from the basics such as blood draw, to laparoscopic surgery and trauma care. They are also important to help on prototyping new devices for biomedical engineering problems. Currently, simulators are applied to research and develop tools for new therapies, treatments and early diagnosis in medicine.\\n\\nMany medical simulators involve a computer connected to a plastic simulation of the relevant anatomy. Sophisticated simulators of this type employ a life-size mannequin that responds to injected drugs and can be programmed to create simulations of life-threatening emergencies.\\n\\nIn other simulations, visual components of the procedure are reproduced by computer graphics techniques, while touch-based components are reproduced by haptic feedback devices combined with physical simulation routines computed in response to the user\\'s actions. Medical simulations of this sort will often use 3D CT or MRI scans of patient data to enhance realism. Some medical simulations are developed to be widely distributed (such as web-enabled simulations and procedural simulations that can be viewed via standard web browsers) and can be interacted with using standard computer interfaces, such as the keyboard and mouse.\\n\\nPlacebo\\n\\nAn important medical application of a simulator—although, perhaps, denoting a slightly different meaning of simulator—is the use of a placebo drug, a formulation that simulates the active drug in trials of drug efficacy.\\n\\nImproving patient safety\\nPatient safety is a concern in the medical industry. Patients have been known to suffer injuries and even death due to management error, and lack of using best standards of care and training. According to Building a National Agenda for Simulation-Based Medical Education (Eder-Van Hook, Jackie, 2004), \"a health care provider\\'s ability to react prudently in an unexpected situation is one of the most critical factors in creating a positive outcome in medical emergency, regardless of whether it occurs on the battlefield, freeway, or hospital emergency room.\" Eder-Van Hook (2004) also noted that medical errors kill up to 98,000 with an estimated cost between $37 and $50\\xa0million and $17 to $29\\xa0billion for preventable adverse events dollars per year.\\n\\nSimulation is being used to study patient safety, as well as train medical professionals. Studying patient safety and safety interventions in healthcare is challenging, because there is a lack of experimental control (i.e., patient complexity, system/process variances) to see if an intervention made a meaningful difference (Groves & Manges, 2017). An example of innovative simulation to study patient safety is from nursing research. Groves et al. (2016) used a high-fidelity simulation to examine nursing safety-oriented behaviors during times such as change-of-shift report.\\n\\nHowever, the value of simulation interventions to translating to clinical practice are is still debatable. As Nishisaki states, \"there is good evidence that simulation training improves provider and team self-efficacy and competence on manikins. There is also good evidence that procedural simulation improves actual operational performance in clinical settings.\" However, there is a need to have improved evidence to show that crew resource management training through simulation. One of the largest challenges is showing that team simulation improves team operational performance at the bedside. Although evidence that simulation-based training actually improves patient outcome has been slow to accrue, today the ability of simulation to provide hands-on experience that translates to the operating room is no longer in doubt.\\n\\nOne of the largest factors that might impact the ability to have training impact the work of practitioners at the bedside is the ability to empower frontline staff (Stewart, Manges, Ward, 2015). Another example of an attempt to improve patient safety through the use of simulations training is patient care to deliver just-in-time service or/and just-in-place. This training consists of 20\\xa0 minutes of simulated training just before workers report to shift. One study found that just in time training improved the transition to the bedside. The conclusion as reported in Nishisaki (2008) work, was that the simulation training improved resident participation in real cases; but did not sacrifice the quality of service. It could be therefore hypothesized that by increasing the number of highly trained residents through the use of simulation training, that the simulation training does, in fact, increase patient safety.\\n\\nHistory of simulation in healthcare\\nThe first medical simulators were simple models of human patients.\\n\\nSince antiquity, these representations in clay and stone were used to demonstrate clinical features of disease states and their effects on humans. Models have been found in many cultures and continents. These models have been used in some cultures (e.g., Chinese culture) as a \"diagnostic\" instrument, allowing women to consult male physicians while maintaining social laws of modesty. Models are used today to help students learn the anatomy of the musculoskeletal system and organ systems.\\n\\nIn 2002, the Society for Simulation in Healthcare (SSH) was formed to become a leader in international interprofessional advances the application of medical simulation in healthcare\\n\\nThe need for a \"uniform mechanism to educate, evaluate, and certify simulation instructors for the health care profession\" was recognized by McGaghie et al. in their critical review of simulation-based medical education research. In 2012 the SSH piloted two new certifications to provide recognition to educators in an effort to meet this need.\\n\\nType of models\\n\\nActive models\\nActive models that attempt to reproduce living anatomy or physiology are recent developments. The famous \"Harvey\" mannequin was developed at the University of Miami and is able to recreate many of the physical findings of the cardiology examination, including palpation, auscultation, and electrocardiography.\\n\\nInteractive models\\nMore recently, interactive models have been developed that respond to actions taken by a student or physician. Until recently, these simulations were two dimensional computer programs that acted more like a textbook than a patient. Computer simulations have the advantage of allowing a student to make judgments, and also to make errors. The process of iterative learning through assessment, evaluation, decision making, and error correction creates a much stronger learning environment than passive instruction.\\n\\nComputer simulators\\n\\nSimulators have been proposed as an ideal tool for assessment of students for clinical skills. For patients, \"cybertherapy\" can be used for sessions simulating traumatic experiences, from fear of heights to social anxiety.\\n\\nProgrammed patients and simulated clinical situations, including mock disaster drills, have been used extensively for education and evaluation. These \"lifelike\" simulations are expensive, and lack reproducibility. A fully functional \"3Di\" simulator would be the most specific tool available for teaching and measurement of clinical skills. Gaming platforms have been applied to create these virtual medical environments to create an interactive method for learning and application of information in a clinical context.\\n\\nImmersive disease state simulations allow a doctor or HCP to experience what a disease actually feels like. Using sensors and transducers symptomatic effects can be delivered to a participant allowing them to experience the patients disease state.\\n\\nSuch a simulator meets the goals of an objective and standardized examination for clinical competence. This system is superior to examinations that use \"standard patients\" because it permits the quantitative measurement of competence, as well as reproducing the same objective findings.\\n\\nSimulation in entertainment\\nSimulation in entertainment encompasses many large and popular industries such as film, television, video games (including serious games) and rides in theme parks. Although modern simulation is thought to have its roots in training and the military, in the 20th century it also became a conduit for enterprises which were more hedonistic in nature.\\n\\nHistory of visual simulation in film and games\\n\\nEarly history (1940s and 1950s)\\nThe first simulation game may have been created as early as 1947 by Thomas T. Goldsmith Jr. and Estle Ray Mann. This was a straightforward game that simulated a missile being fired at a target. The curve of the missile and its speed could be adjusted using several knobs. In 1958, a computer game called Tennis for Two was created by Willy Higginbotham which simulated a tennis game between two players who could both play at the same time using hand controls and was displayed on an oscilloscope. This was one of the first electronic video games to use a graphical display.\\n\\n1970s and early 1980s\\nComputer-generated imagery was used in the film to simulate objects as early as 1972 in A Computer Animated Hand, parts of which were shown on the big screen in the 1976 film Futureworld. This was followed by the \"targeting computer\" that young Skywalker turns off in the 1977 film Star Wars.\\n\\nThe film Tron (1982) was the first film to use computer-generated imagery for more than a couple of minutes.\\n\\nAdvances in technology in the 1980s caused 3D simulation to become more widely used and it began to appear in movies and in computer-based games such as Atari\\'s Battlezone (1980) and Acornsoft\\'s Elite (1984), one of the first wire-frame 3D graphics games for home computers.\\n\\nPre-virtual cinematography era (early 1980s to 1990s)\\nAdvances in technology in the 1980s made the computer more affordable and more capable than they were in previous decades, which facilitated the rise of computer such as the Xbox gaming. The first video game consoles released in the 1970s and early 1980s fell prey to the industry crash in 1983, but in 1985, Nintendo released the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) which became one of the best selling consoles in video game history. In the 1990s, computer games became widely popular with the release of such game as The Sims and Command & Conquer and the still increasing power of desktop computers. Today, computer simulation games such as World of Warcraft are played by millions of people around the world.\\n\\nIn 1993, the film Jurassic Park became the first popular film to use computer-generated graphics extensively, integrating the simulated dinosaurs almost seamlessly into live action scenes.\\n\\nThis event transformed the film industry; in 1995, the film Toy Story was the first film to use only computer-generated images and by the new millennium computer generated graphics were the leading choice for special effects in films.\\n\\nVirtual cinematography (early 2000s–present)\\nThe advent of virtual cinematography in the early 2000s has led to an explosion of movies that would have been impossible to shoot without it. Classic examples are the digital look-alikes of Neo, Smith and other characters in the Matrix sequels and the extensive use of physically impossible camera runs in The Lord of the Rings trilogy.\\n\\nThe terminal in the Pan Am (TV series) no longer existed during the filming of this 2011–2012 aired series, which was no problem as they created it in virtual cinematography using automated viewpoint finding and matching in conjunction with compositing real and simulated footage, which has been the bread and butter of the movie artist in and around film studios since the early 2000s.\\n\\nComputer-generated imagery is \"the application of the field of 3D computer graphics to special effects\". This technology is used for visual effects because they are high in quality, controllable, and can create effects that would not be feasible using any other technology either because of cost, resources or safety. Computer-generated graphics can be seen in many live-action movies today, especially those of the action genre. Further, computer-generated imagery has almost completely supplanted hand-drawn animation in children\\'s movies which are increasingly computer-generated only. Examples of movies that use computer-generated imagery include Finding Nemo, 300 and Iron Man.\\n\\nExamples of non-film entertainment simulation\\n\\nSimulation games\\nSimulation games, as opposed to other genres of video and computer games, represent or simulate an environment accurately. Moreover, they represent the interactions between the playable characters and the environment realistically. These kinds of games are usually more complex in terms of gameplay. Simulation games have become incredibly popular among people of all ages. Popular simulation games include SimCity and Tiger Woods PGA Tour. There are also flight simulator and driving simulator games.\\n\\nTheme park rides\\nSimulators have been used for entertainment since the Link Trainer in the 1930s. The first modern simulator ride to open at a theme park was Disney\\'s Star Tours in 1987 soon followed by Universal\\'s The Funtastic World of Hanna-Barbera in 1990 which was the first ride to be done entirely with computer graphics.\\n\\nSimulator rides are the progeny of military training simulators and commercial simulators, but they are different in a fundamental way. While military training simulators react realistically to the input of the trainee in real time, ride simulators only feel like they move realistically and move according to prerecorded motion scripts. One of the first simulator rides, Star Tours, which cost $32\\xa0million, used a hydraulic motion based cabin. The movement was programmed by a joystick. Today\\'s simulator rides, such as The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man include elements to increase the amount of immersion experienced by the riders such as: 3D imagery, physical effects (spraying water or producing scents), and movement through an environment.\\n\\nSimulation and manufacturing\\nManufacturing simulation represents one of the most important applications of simulation. This technique represents a valuable tool used by engineers when evaluating the effect of capital investment in equipment and physical facilities like factory plants, warehouses, and distribution centers. Simulation can be used to predict the performance of an existing or planned system and to compare alternative solutions for a particular design problem.\\n\\nAnother important goal of simulation in manufacturing systems is to quantify system performance. Common measures of system performance include the following:\\n Throughput under average and peak loads\\n System cycle time (how long it takes to produce one part)\\n Use of resource, labor, and machines\\n Bottlenecks and choke points\\n Queuing at work locations\\n Queuing and delays caused by material-handling devices and systems\\n WIP storages needs\\n Staffing requirements\\n Effectiveness of scheduling systems\\n Effectiveness of control systems\\n\\nMore examples of simulation\\n\\nAutomobiles\\n\\nAn automobile simulator provides an opportunity to reproduce the characteristics of real vehicles in a virtual environment. It replicates the external factors and conditions with which a vehicle interacts enabling a driver to feel as if they are sitting in the cab of their own vehicle. Scenarios and events are replicated with sufficient reality to ensure that drivers become fully immersed in the experience rather than simply viewing it as an educational experience.\\n\\nThe simulator provides a constructive experience for the novice driver and enables more complex exercises to be undertaken by the more mature driver. For novice drivers, truck simulators provide an opportunity to begin their career by applying best practice. For mature drivers, simulation provides the ability to enhance good driving or to detect poor practice and to suggest the necessary steps for remedial action. For companies, it provides an opportunity to educate staff in the driving skills that achieve reduced maintenance costs, improved productivity and, most importantly, to ensure the safety of their actions in all possible situations.\\n\\nBiomechanics\\n\\nA biomechanics simulator is a simulation platform for creating dynamic mechanical models built from combinations of rigid and deformable bodies, joints, constraints, and various force actuators. It is specialized for creating biomechanical models of human anatomical structures, with the intention to study their function and eventually assist in the design and planning of medical treatment.\\n\\nA biomechanics simulator is used to analyze walking dynamics, study sports performance, simulate surgical procedures, analyze joint loads, design medical devices, and animate human and animal movement.\\n\\nA neuromechanical simulator that combines biomechanical and biologically realistic neural network simulation. It allows the user to test hypotheses on the neural basis of behavior in a physically accurate 3-D virtual environment.\\n\\nCity and urban\\n\\nA city simulator can be a city-building game but can also be a tool used by urban planners to understand how cities are likely to evolve in response to various policy decisions. AnyLogic is an example of modern, large-scale urban simulators designed for use by urban planners. City simulators are generally agent-based simulations with explicit representations for land use and transportation. UrbanSim and LEAM are examples of large-scale urban simulation models that are used by metropolitan planning agencies and military bases for land use and transportation planning.\\n\\nChristmas\\n\\nSeveral Christmas-themed simulations exist, many of which are centred around Santa Claus. An example of these simulations are websites which claim to allow the user to track Santa Claus. Due to the fact that Santa is a legendary character and not a real, living person, it is impossible to provide actual information on his location, and services such as NORAD Tracks Santa and the Google Santa Tracker (the former of which claims to use radar and other technologies to track Santa) display fake, predetermined location information to users. Another example of these simulations are websites that claim to allow the user to email or send messages to Santa Claus. Websites such as emailSanta.com or Santa\\'s former page on the now-defunct Windows Live Spaces by Microsoft use automated programs or scripts to generate personalized replies claimed to be from Santa himself based on user input.\\n\\nClassroom of the future\\n\\nThe classroom of the future will probably contain several kinds of simulators, in addition to textual and visual learning tools. This will allow students to enter the clinical years better prepared, and with a higher skill level. The advanced student or postgraduate will have a more concise and comprehensive method of retraining—or of incorporating new clinical procedures into their skill set—and regulatory bodies and medical institutions will find it easier to assess the proficiency and competency of individuals.\\n\\nThe classroom of the future will also form the basis of a clinical skills unit for continuing education of medical personnel; and in the same way that the use of periodic flight training assists airline pilots, this technology will assist practitioners throughout their career.\\n\\nThe simulator will be more than a \"living\" textbook, it will become an integral a part of the practice of medicine. The simulator environment will also provide a standard platform for curriculum development in institutions of medical education.\\n\\nCommunication satellites\\n\\nModern satellite communications systems (SATCOM) are often large and complex with many interacting parts and elements. In addition, the need for broadband connectivity on a moving vehicle has increased dramatically in the past few years for both commercial and military applications. To accurately predict and deliver high quality of service, SATCOM system designers have to factor in terrain as well as atmospheric and meteorological conditions in their planning. To deal with such complexity, system designers and operators increasingly turn towards computer models of their systems to simulate real-world operating conditions and gain insights into usability and requirements prior to final product sign-off. Modeling improves the understanding of the system by enabling the SATCOM system designer or planner to simulate real-world performance by injecting the models with multiple hypothetical atmospheric and environmental conditions. Simulation is often used in the training of civilian and military personnel. This usually occurs when it is prohibitively expensive or simply too dangerous to allow trainees to use the real equipment in the real world. In such situations, they will spend time learning valuable lessons in a \"safe\" virtual environment yet living a lifelike experience (or at least it is the goal). Often the convenience is to permit mistakes during training for a safety-critical system.\\n\\nDigital lifecycle\\n\\nSimulation solutions are being increasingly integrated with computer-aided solutions and processes (computer-aided design or CAD, computer-aided manufacturing or CAM, computer-aided engineering or CAE, etc.). The use of simulation throughout the product lifecycle, especially at the earlier concept and design stages, has the potential of providing substantial benefits. These benefits range from direct cost issues such as reduced prototyping and shorter time-to-market to better performing products and higher margins. However, for some companies, simulation has not provided the expected benefits.\\n\\nThe successful use of simulation, early in the lifecycle, has been largely driven by increased integration of simulation tools with the entire set of CAD, CAM and product-lifecycle management solutions. Simulation solutions can now function across the extended enterprise in a multi-CAD environment, and include solutions for managing simulation data and processes and ensuring that simulation results are made part of the product lifecycle history.\\n\\nDisaster preparedness\\nSimulation training has become a method for preparing people for disasters. Simulations can replicate emergency situations and track how learners respond thanks to a lifelike experience. Disaster preparedness simulations can involve training on how to handle terrorism attacks, natural disasters, pandemic outbreaks, or other life-threatening emergencies.\\n\\nOne organization that has used simulation training for disaster preparedness is CADE (Center for Advancement of Distance Education). CADE has used a video game to prepare emergency workers for multiple types of attacks. As reported by News-Medical.Net, \"The video game is the first in a series of simulations to address bioterrorism, pandemic flu, smallpox, and other disasters that emergency personnel must prepare for.\" Developed by a team from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), the game allows learners to practice their emergency skills in a safe, controlled environment.\\n\\nThe Emergency Simulation Program (ESP) at the British Columbia Institute of Technology (BCIT), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is another example of an organization that uses simulation to train for emergency situations. ESP uses simulation to train on the following situations: forest fire fighting, oil or chemical spill response, earthquake response, law enforcement, municipal firefighting, hazardous material handling, military training, and response to terrorist attack One feature of the simulation system is the implementation of \"Dynamic Run-Time Clock,\" which allows simulations to run a \\'simulated\\' time frame, \"\\'speeding up\\' or \\'slowing down\\' time as desired\" Additionally, the system allows session recordings, picture-icon based navigation, file storage of individual simulations, multimedia components, and launch external applications.\\n\\nAt the University of Québec in Chicoutimi, a research team at the outdoor research and expertise laboratory (Laboratoire d\\'Expertise et de Recherche en Plein Air – LERPA) specializes in using wilderness backcountry accident simulations to verify emergency response coordination.\\n\\nInstructionally, the benefits of emergency training through simulations are that learner performance can be tracked through the system. This allows the developer to make adjustments as necessary or alert the educator on topics that may require additional attention. Other advantages are that the learner can be guided or trained on how to respond appropriately before continuing to the next emergency segment—this is an aspect that may not be available in the live environment. Some emergency training simulators also allow for immediate feedback, while other simulations may provide a summary and instruct the learner to engage in the learning topic again.\\n\\nIn a live-emergency situation, emergency responders do not have time to waste. Simulation-training in this environment provides an opportunity for learners to gather as much information as they can and practice their knowledge in a safe environment. They can make mistakes without risk of endangering lives and be given the opportunity to correct their errors to prepare for the real-life emergency.\\n\\nEconomics\\n\\nSimulations in economics and especially in macroeconomics, judge the desirability of the effects of proposed policy actions, such as fiscal policy changes or monetary policy changes. A mathematical model of the economy, having been fitted to historical economic data, is used as a proxy for the actual economy; proposed values of government spending, taxation, open market operations, etc. are used as inputs to the simulation of the model, and various variables of interest such as the inflation rate, the unemployment rate, the balance of trade deficit, the government budget deficit, etc. are the outputs of the simulation. The simulated values of these variables of interest are compared for different proposed policy inputs to determine which set of outcomes is most desirable.\\n\\nEngineering, technology, and processes\\nSimulation is an important feature in engineering systems or any system that involves many processes. For example, in electrical engineering, delay lines may be used to simulate propagation delay and phase shift caused by an actual transmission line. Similarly, dummy loads may be used to simulate impedance without simulating propagation and is used in situations where propagation is unwanted. A simulator may imitate only a few of the operations and functions of the unit it simulates. Contrast with: emulate.\\n\\nMost engineering simulations entail mathematical modeling and computer-assisted investigation. There are many cases, however, where mathematical modeling is not reliable. Simulation of fluid dynamics problems often require both mathematical and physical simulations. In these cases the physical models require dynamic similitude. Physical and chemical simulations have also direct realistic uses, rather than research uses; in chemical engineering, for example, process simulations are used to give the process parameters immediately used for operating chemical plants, such as oil refineries. Simulators are also used for plant operator training. It is called Operator Training Simulator (OTS) and has been widely adopted by many industries from chemical to oil&gas and to the power industry. This created a safe and realistic virtual environment to train board operators and engineers. Mimic is capable of providing high fidelity dynamic models of nearly all chemical plants for operator training and control system testing.\\n\\nErgonomics\\nErgonomic simulation involves the analysis of virtual products or manual tasks within a virtual environment. In the engineering process, the aim of ergonomics is to develop and to improve the design of products and work environments. Ergonomic simulation utilizes an anthropometric virtual representation of the human, commonly referenced as a mannequin or Digital Human Models (DHMs), to mimic the postures, mechanical loads, and performance of a human operator in a simulated environment such as an airplane, automobile, or manufacturing facility. DHMs are recognized as evolving and valuable tool for performing proactive ergonomics analysis and design. The simulations employ 3D-graphics and physics-based models to animate the virtual humans. Ergonomics software uses inverse kinematics (IK) capability for posing the DHMs.\\n\\nSoftware tools typically calculate biomechanical properties including individual muscle forces, joint forces and moments. Most of these tools employ standard ergonomic evaluation methods such as the NIOSH lifting equation and Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA). Some simulations also analyze physiological measures including metabolism, energy expenditure, and fatigue limits Cycle time studies, design and process validation, user comfort, reachability, and line of sight are other human-factors that may be examined in ergonomic simulation packages.\\n\\nModeling and simulation of a task can be performed by manually manipulating the virtual human in the simulated environment. Some ergonomics simulation software permits interactive, real-time simulation and evaluation through actual human input via motion capture technologies. However, motion capture for ergonomics requires expensive equipment and the creation of props to represent the environment or product.\\n\\nSome applications of ergonomic simulation in include analysis of solid waste collection, disaster management tasks, interactive gaming, automotive assembly line, virtual prototyping of rehabilitation aids, and aerospace product design. Ford engineers use ergonomics simulation software to perform virtual product design reviews. Using engineering data, the simulations assist evaluation of assembly ergonomics. The company uses Siemen\\'s Jack and Jill ergonomics simulation software in improving worker safety and efficiency, without the need to build expensive prototypes.\\n\\nFinance\\n\\nIn finance, computer simulations are often used for scenario planning. Risk-adjusted net present value, for example, is computed from well-defined but not always known (or fixed) inputs. By imitating the performance of the project under evaluation, simulation can provide a distribution of NPV over a range of discount rates and other variables. Simulations are also often used to test a financial theory or the ability of a financial model.\\n\\nSimulations are frequently used in financial training to engage participants in experiencing various historical as well as fictional situations. There are stock market simulations, portfolio simulations, risk management simulations or models and forex simulations. Such simulations are typically based on stochastic asset models. Using these simulations in a training program allows for the application of theory into a something akin to real life. As with other industries, the use of simulations can be technology or case-study driven.\\n\\nFlight\\n\\nFlight simulation training devices (FSTD) are used to train pilots on the ground. In comparison to training in an actual aircraft, simulation-based training allows for the training of maneuvers or situations that may be impractical (or even dangerous) to perform in the aircraft while keeping the pilot and instructor in a relatively low-risk environment on the ground. For example, electrical system failures, instrument failures, hydraulic system failures, and even flight control failures can be simulated without risk to the pilots or an aircraft.\\n\\nInstructors can also provide students with a higher concentration of training tasks in a given period of time than is usually possible in the aircraft. For example, conducting multiple instrument approaches in the actual aircraft may require significant time spent repositioning the aircraft, while in a simulation, as soon as one approach has been completed, the instructor can immediately preposition the simulated aircraft to an ideal (or less than ideal) location from which to begin the next approach.\\n\\nFlight simulation also provides an economic advantage over training in an actual aircraft. Once fuel, maintenance, and insurance costs are taken into account, the operating costs of an FSTD are usually substantially lower than the operating costs of the simulated aircraft. For some large transport category airplanes, the operating costs may be several times lower for the FSTD than the actual aircraft.\\n\\nSome people who use simulator software, especially flight simulator software, build their own simulator at home. Some people—to further the realism of their homemade simulator—buy used cards and racks that run the same software used by the original machine. While this involves solving the problem of matching hardware and software—and the problem that hundreds of cards plug into many different racks—many still find that solving these problems is well worthwhile. Some are so serious about a realistic simulation that they will buy real aircraft parts, like complete nose sections of written-off aircraft, at aircraft boneyards. This permits people to simulate a hobby that they are unable to pursue in real life.\\n\\nMarine\\n\\nBearing resemblance to flight simulators, a marine simulator trains ships\\' personnel. The most common marine simulators include:\\n Ship\\'s bridge simulators\\n Engine room simulators\\n Cargo handling simulators\\n Communication / GMDSS simulators\\n ROV simulators\\n\\nSimulators like these are mostly used within maritime colleges, training institutions, and navies. They often consist of a replication of a ships\\' bridge, with the operating console(s), and a number of screens on which the virtual surroundings are projected.\\n\\nMilitary\\n\\nMilitary simulations, also known informally as war games, are models in which theories of warfare can be tested and refined without the need for actual hostilities. They exist in many different forms, with varying degrees of realism. In recent times, their scope has widened to include not only military but also political and social factors (for example, the Nationlab series of strategic exercises in Latin America). While many governments make use of simulation, both individually and collaboratively, little is known about the model\\'s specifics outside professional circles.\\n\\nNetwork and distributed systems\\nNetwork and distributed systems have been extensively simulated in other to understand the impact of new protocols and algorithms before their deployment in the actual systems. The simulation can focus on different levels (physical layer, network layer, application layer), and evaluate different metrics (network bandwidth, resource consumption, service time, dropped packets, system availability). Examples of simulation scenarios of network and distributed systems are:\\n\\n Content delivery networks\\n Smart cities\\n Internet of things\\n\\nPayment and securities settlement system\\nSimulation techniques have also been applied to payment and securities settlement systems. Among the main users are central banks who are generally responsible for the oversight of market infrastructure and entitled to contribute to the smooth functioning of the payment systems.\\n\\nCentral banks have been using payment system simulations to evaluate things such as the adequacy or sufficiency of liquidity available ( in the form of account balances and intraday credit limits) to participants (mainly banks) to allow efficient settlement of payments. The need for liquidity is also dependent on the availability and the type of netting procedures in the systems, thus some of the studies have a focus on system comparisons.\\n\\nAnother application is to evaluate risks related to events such as communication network breakdowns or the inability of participants to send payments (e.g. in case of possible bank failure). This kind of analysis falls under the concepts of stress testing or scenario analysis.\\n\\nA common way to conduct these simulations is to replicate the settlement logics of the real payment or securities settlement systems under analysis and then use real observed payment data. In case of system comparison or system development, naturally, also the other settlement logics need to be implemented.\\n\\nTo perform stress testing and scenario analysis, the observed data needs to be altered, e.g. some payments delayed or removed. To analyze the levels of liquidity, initial liquidity levels are varied. System comparisons (benchmarking) or evaluations of new netting algorithms or rules are performed by running simulations with a fixed set of data and varying only the system setups.\\n\\nAn inference is usually done by comparing the benchmark simulation results to the results of altered simulation setups by comparing indicators such as unsettled transactions or settlement delays.\\n\\nProject management\\n\\nProject management simulation is simulation used for project management training and analysis. It is often used as a training simulation for project managers. In other cases, it is used for what-if analysis and for supporting decision-making in real projects. Frequently the simulation is conducted using software tools.\\n\\nRobotics\\n\\nA robotics simulator is used to create embedded applications for a specific (or not) robot without being dependent on the \\'real\\' robot. In some cases, these applications can be transferred to the real robot (or rebuilt) without modifications. Robotics simulators allow reproducing situations that cannot be \\'created\\' in the real world because of cost, time, or the \\'uniqueness\\' of a resource. A simulator also allows fast robot prototyping. Many robot simulators feature physics engines to simulate a robot\\'s dynamics.\\n\\nProduction\\nSimulation of production systems is used mainly to examine the effect of improvements or investments in a production system. Most often this is done using a static spreadsheet with process times and transportation times. For more sophisticated simulations Discrete Event Simulation (DES) is used with the advantages to simulate dynamics in the production system. A production system is very much dynamic depending on variations in manufacturing processes, assembly times, machine set-ups, breaks, breakdowns and small stoppages. There is much software commonly used for discrete event simulation. They differ in usability and markets but do often share the same foundation.\\n\\nSales process\\n\\nSimulations are useful in modeling the flow of transactions through business processes, such as in the field of sales process engineering, to study and improve the flow of customer orders through various stages of completion (say, from an initial proposal for providing goods/services through order acceptance and installation). Such simulations can help predict the impact of how improvements in methods might impact variability, cost, labor time, and the number of transactions at various stages in the process. A full-featured computerized process simulator can be used to depict such models, as can simpler educational demonstrations using spreadsheet software, pennies being transferred between cups based on the roll of a die, or dipping into a tub of colored beads with a scoop.\\n\\nSports\\nIn sports, computer simulations are often done to predict the outcome of events and the performance of individual sportspeople. They attempt to recreate the event through models built from statistics. The increase in technology has allowed anyone with knowledge of programming the ability to run simulations of their models. The simulations are built from a series of mathematical algorithms, or models, and can vary with accuracy. Accuscore, which is licensed by companies such as ESPN, is a well-known simulation program for all major sports. It offers a detailed analysis of games through simulated betting lines, projected point totals and overall probabilities.\\n\\nWith the increased interest in fantasy sports simulation models that predict individual player performance have gained popularity. Companies like What If Sports and StatFox specialize in not only using their simulations for predicting game results but how well individual players will do as well. Many people use models to determine whom to start in their fantasy leagues.\\n\\nAnother way simulations are helping the sports field is in the use of biomechanics. Models are derived and simulations are run from data received from sensors attached to athletes and video equipment. Sports biomechanics aided by simulation models answer questions regarding training techniques such as the effect of fatigue on throwing performance (height of throw) and biomechanical factors of the upper limbs (reactive strength index; hand contact time).\\n\\nComputer simulations allow their users to take models which before were too complex to run, and give them answers. Simulations have proven to be some of the best insights into both play performance and team predictability.\\n\\nSpace shuttle countdown\\n\\nSimulation was used at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to train and certify Space Shuttle engineers during simulated launch countdown operations. The Space Shuttle engineering community would participate in a launch countdown integrated simulation before each Shuttle flight. This simulation is a virtual simulation where real people interact with simulated Space Shuttle vehicle and Ground Support Equipment (GSE) hardware. The Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation, also known as S0044, involved countdown processes that would integrate many of the Space Shuttle vehicle and GSE systems. Some of the Shuttle systems integrated in the simulation are the main propulsion system, RS-25, solid rocket boosters, ground liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, external tank, flight controls, navigation, and avionics. The high-level objectives of the Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation are:\\n To demonstrate firing room final countdown phase operations.\\n To provide training for system engineers in recognizing, reporting and evaluating system problems in a time critical environment.\\n To exercise the launch team\\'s ability to evaluate, prioritize and respond to problems in an integrated manner within a time critical environment.\\n To provide procedures to be used in performing failure/recovery testing of the operations performed in the final countdown phase.\\n\\nThe Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation took place at the Kennedy Space Center Launch Control Center firing rooms. The firing room used during the simulation is the same control room where real launch countdown operations are executed. As a result, equipment used for real launch countdown operations is engaged. Command and control computers, application software, engineering plotting and trending tools, launch countdown procedure documents, launch commit criteria documents, hardware requirement documents, and any other items used by the engineering launch countdown teams during real launch countdown operations are used during the simulation.\\n\\nThe Space Shuttle vehicle hardware and related GSE hardware is simulated by mathematical models (written in Shuttle Ground Operations Simulator (SGOS) modeling language) that behave and react like real hardware. During the Shuttle Final Countdown Phase Simulation, engineers command and control hardware via real application software executing in the control consoles – just as if they were commanding real vehicle hardware. However, these real software applications do not interface with real Shuttle hardware during simulations. Instead, the applications interface with mathematical model representations of the vehicle and GSE hardware. Consequently, the simulations bypass sensitive and even dangerous mechanisms while providing engineering measurements detailing how the hardware would have reacted. Since these math models interact with the command and control application software, models and simulations are also used to debug and verify the functionality of application software.\\n\\nSatellite navigation\\n\\nThe only true way to test GNSS receivers (commonly known as Sat-Nav\\'s in the commercial world) is by using an RF Constellation Simulator. A receiver that may, for example, be used on an aircraft, can be tested under dynamic conditions without the need to take it on a real flight. The test conditions can be repeated exactly, and there is full control over all the test parameters. this is not possible in the \\'real-world\\' using the actual signals. For testing receivers that will use the new Galileo (satellite navigation) there is no alternative, as the real signals do not yet exist.\\n\\nWeather\\n\\nPredicting weather conditions by extrapolating/interpolating previous data is one of the real use of simulation. Most of the weather forecasts use this information published by Weather bureaus. This kind of simulations helps in predicting and forewarning about extreme weather conditions like the path of an active hurricane/cyclone. Numerical weather prediction for forecasting involves complicated numeric computer models to predict weather accurately by taking many parameters into account.\\n\\nSimulation games\\n\\nStrategy games—both traditional and modern—may be viewed as simulations of abstracted decision-making for the purpose of training military and political leaders (see History of Go for an example of such a tradition, or Kriegsspiel for a more recent example).\\n\\nMany other video games are simulators of some kind. Such games can simulate various aspects of reality, from business, to government, to construction, to piloting vehicles (see above).\\n\\nHistorical usage\\nHistorically, the word had negative connotations:\\n\\nHowever, the connection between simulation and dissembling later faded out and is now only of linguistic interest.\\n\\nSee also\\n\\n Computational astrophysics\\n Computational chemistry\\n Computational fluid dynamics\\n Computational physics\\n Computer experiment\\n Educational technology\\n First-person (gaming)\\n Futures studies\\n Grey box model\\n Illustris project\\n In silico\\n List of computer simulation software\\n List of discrete event simulation software\\n Merger simulation\\n Microarchitecture simulation\\n Mining simulator\\n Molecular dynamics\\n Monte Carlo algorithm\\n Network simulation\\n Pharmacokinetics simulation\\n Planet Simulator\\n Roleplay simulation\\n Rule-based modeling\\n Simulated reality\\n Simulation language\\n System identification\\n Telepresence\\n Training simulation\\n UltraHLE\\n Web-based simulation\\n Virtual reality\\n Simulation hypothesis\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nExternal links\\n\\n Bibliographies containing more references to be found on the website of the journal Simulation & Gaming.\\n\\nSimulation\\nModeling and simulation\\nMathematical and quantitative methods (economics)']\n"
